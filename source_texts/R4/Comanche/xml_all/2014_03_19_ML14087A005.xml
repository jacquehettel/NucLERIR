The plant responded as expected to the transient. The cause of this event was a Unit I Generator Current Transformer (CT) cable shorting to ground. Vibration of the cable and contact of the cable with the free end of the conduit resulted in physical wear of the cable jacket and insulation that over the period of more than 12 years (from 2002 to 2014) cut through the jacket and insulation and allowed the conductor to contact the metal of the conduit. The corrective actions included reworking the grounded cable. The Unit 1 and Unit 2 Generator CT cables will be inspected, insulated, retrained, and/or replaced at each unit's next refueling outage. The Unit I and Unit 2 Generator CT conduits will have insulated bushings installed at the conduit exits where the conduit is not connected to a device or panel within a hub.

PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT 
On January 18,2014, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP) Unit 1 was in MODE I operating at approximately 100% power. 
</P><P>C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT </P><P>There were no inoperable structures, systems or components that contributed to the event. </P><P>D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES </P><P>At 0840 hours, on January 18,2014, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power when an automatic reactor trip occurred due to a Generator Current Transfomler (CT) lockout relay trip and turbine trip. All control rods inserted. A Generator Negative Sequence Current High Alarm was received immediately prior to the turbine trip. </P><P>The plant responded as expected to the transient. Both Motor Driven Auxilial)' Feed Water Pumps and the Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feed Water Pump started in response to Steam Generator Lo-Lo Levels. </P><P>Decay heat was rejected to the Main Condensor via Steam Dump Valves (Turbine Bypass Valves). </P><P>There was no impact to CPNPP Unit 2 and offsite power remained available. </P><P>Megger testing performed for the generator identified a hard ground condition on the A phase of the Generator CT [EllS: (TB)(XCT)]. Upon further inspection, damaged insulation was observed on the Generator CT cable NK129494. The cable was manipulated to isolate it from its conduit, and the Megger was successfully perfomled, indicating the cause of the ground condition. </P><P>The generator and excitation systems were evaluated for potential damage by data review, and it was concluded there was no consequential damage. </P><P>E.

CAUSE OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE Not Applicable -There were no component or system failures. B. FAILURE MODE, MECHANISM, AND EFFECTS OF EACH FAILED COMPONENT Not Applicable -There were no component or system failures. C. SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY FAILURE OF COMPONENTS WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS Not Applicable -There were no component or system failures. D. FAILED COMPONENT INFORMATION Not Applicable -There were no component or system failures. Ill. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT A. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED An automatic reactor trip occurred as a result of a generator trip and turbine trip. The auxiliary feed water system responded as expected as a result of the reactor trip. B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY Not applicable -no safety system trains were inoperable as a result of this event. C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT This event is bounded by the CPNPP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident analysis which assumes conservative initial conditions which bound the plant operating range and other assumptions which could reduce the capability of safety systems to mitigate the consequences of the transient. This event is also bounded by the analysis of the turbine trip presented in Section 15.2.3 of the CPNPP FSAR. The analysis uses conservative assumptions to demonstrate the capability of pressure relieving devices and to demonstrate core protection margins. The event of January 18, 2014, OCCUlTed at approximately 100% reactor power, and required systems and components functioned as designed. Based on the above, it is concluded that the health and safety of the public were unaffected by this condition and this event has been evaluated to not meet the definition ofa safety system functional failure per IOCFR50.73(a)(2)(v). </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (02·2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

CAUSE OF THE EVENT The cause of the trip was an actuation of the Generator CT lockout relay which actuated as a result of the Differential Relay Phase A Generator 1 actuation. The Differential Relay Phase A Generator 1 actuated due to the Generator CT cable (NK129494) shorting to ground. The Negative Sequence Relay also actuated the negative sequence alarm due to the cable NKI29494 shorting to ground. The manner in which the flexible conduit is installed, without securing attachments at the Generator CT, allowed the flexible conduit to be moved by vibration and high ventilation air flows. Where the NKI29494 cable exited the flexible conduit, it was in contact with the edge of the flexible conduit. An insulated bushing was not installed on the end ofthe flexible conduit. These conditions resulted in physical wear of the cable jacket and insulation that, over the period of more than 12 years (from 2002 to 2014), cut through the jacket and insulation and allowed the conductor to contact the metal of the conduit. The 2002 design configuration allowed some motion of the flexible conduit that contributed to wear through of the cable jacket and insulation. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The corrective actions included reworking the grounded cable (NK129494) and inspecting and insulating the remaining Unit 1 Generator CT cables. As part ofthe CPNPP Corrective Action Progranl the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Generator CT cables will be inspected, insulated, retrained, and / or replaced at the unit's next refueling outage. The Unit 1 and Unit 2 Generator CT conduits will have insulated bushings installed at the conduit exits where the conduit is not connected to a device or panel within a hub. Unit I and Unit 2 preventive maintenance procedures will be revised to inspect for cable damage, connection integrity, and Meggering of the CT leads. VI. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There were no previous similar events in the last three years. On June 27,1994, a Unit 2 reactor trip occurred due to an actuation of the Main Generator Differential Relay (CPNPP Unit 2 Licensee Event Report 94-0 10-00). This resulted from insulation damage to the Generator CT wiring due to heating of the conduit by induced magnetic fields. The damage to the insulation allowed the wire to short to the conduit. This issue was addressed in the Corrective Action Program. The details /causes of the June 27,1994 event are sufficiently different from the event described in this LER such that the previous corrective actions could not have prevented the January 18, 2014 event. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
