EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE) [8J SUBMISSION NO DATE ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i,e&quot; approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 2146 Central Standard Time (CST) on 111112013, Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power when the reactor tripped during Solid State Protection System (SSPS) slave relay testing. This test utilizes a blocking circuit to verify the operability ofthe slave relay which trips the main turbine and both main feedwater pump turbines, on a Hi-Hi steam generator level or safety injection (SI). While positioning the slave relay switch in a testing lineup, the relay actuated. The Unit 2 turbine tripped as well as both main feedwater pumps. The trip of both main feedwater pumps started all three Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pumps. All systems responded as expected. The cause of the Unit 2 reactor trip was an original design issue with the main turbine test cabinet. The corrective action is to add a test signal electrical interlock with the blocking relay to prevent slave relay actuation until the block is established for test circuits in Units 1 and 2. All times in this rep0l1 are approximate and CST unless noted otherwise. </Figure><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION: 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) &quot;Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation ofany of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).&quot; B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT: On November 1, 2013, Comanche Peak Unit 2 was in Mode 1, Power Operation, operating at approximately 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT There were no inoperable structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES: Procedure OPT-406B-l performs the surveillance test ofthe Unit 2 Train A K620 slave relay. The test utilizes a blocking circuit to verify the operability of the slave relay which trips the main turbine and both main feedwater pump turbines, on a HI-HI steam generator level or safety injection (SI). No actuation should occur. The procedure step 17 turns switch 2-TS-lIK620 to the PUSH TO TEST position. The PUSH TO TEST position establishes the block ofthe main turbine and feedwater trip signal from auxiliary relay 2-KXAl0620A. Step 18 verifies the block, then step 19 actuates the relay by depressing the switch. On November 1,2013 at 2146 CST, the Unit 2 Reactor Operator (utility, licensed) at the CP2-EIPRCV-13 cabinet in the control room was turning switch 2-TS-I/K620 to the PUSH TO TEST position in accordance with procedure OPT -406B-l step 17 when the unanticipated trip of the main turbine and feedwater pumps occurred followed by automatic actuation of a reactor trip. The control room operators immediately entered procedure EOP-O.OB, &quot;Reactor Trip or Safety Injection&quot; in response to the reactor trip. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT This event is bounded by the CPNPP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident analysis which assumes conservative initial conditions which bound the plant operating range and other assumptions which could reduce the capability of safety systems to mitigate the consequences of the transient. This event is bounded by the analysis ofthe turbine trip presented in Section 15.2.3 of the CPNPP FSAR. The analysis uses a conservative assumption to demonstrate the capability of pressure relieving devices and to demonstrate core protection margins. The event ofNovember 1,2013, occurred at 100% reactor power, and all systems and components functioned as designed. Based on the above, it is concluded that the health and safety of the public were unaffected by this condition and this event has been evaluated to not meet the definition ofa safety system functional failure per 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v). IV. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The direct cause of the event was an invalid input from switch 2-TS-I/K620 during the rotation to the PUSH TO TEST position that resulted in the unanticipated actuation ofauxiliary relay 2-KXAl0620 before blocking the output with relay 2-KT/0080-1. The cause is that the original design for the 2-KXA/0620A test circuit in CP2-EIPRCV-13 did not include an electrical interlock to address the possibility ofthe 2-TS-I/K620 L21-L22 contact closing prior to establishing the block of end device actuation. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The interim corrective action is to not perform the test in Mode 1. The long term corrective action is to add a test signal electrical interlock with the blocking relay to prevent slave relay actuation until the block is established for test circuits in Units 1 and 2. VI. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There have been no previous similar reportable events at CPNPP in the last three years. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
