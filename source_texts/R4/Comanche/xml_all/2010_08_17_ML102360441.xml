TS SR 3.0.3 was entered for the affected components and ~isk assessments were completed which supported continued operability until such time as the STP could be verified to adequately implement the testing requirements to meet the SR or the affected components could be adequately tested. The cause of this event is still being determined and a supplemental report providing this information will be submitted by November 16, 2010. There have been no previous similar occurrences of failure to meet TS SRs due to inadequate STPs in the past three years. All times in this report are approximate and Central Standard Time unless noted otherwise. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REPORTABLE EVENT A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION 10CFRSO.73(a)(2)(i)(B) &quot;Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications&quot; B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT On June 18, 2010, CPNPP Unit 1 and Unit 2 were both in Mode 1 operating at 100% power. I C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO 'THE EVENT There were no inoperable structures, systems, or components that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES CPNPP TS SR 3.3.4.2 requires verification every 18 months that each required Hot Shutdown Panel power and control circuit and transfer switch is capable of performing the intended function. Contrary to this requirement, the existing surveillance test procedure (STP) may not adequately verify that capability. On June 18, 2010, during performance of the Component Design Bases Inspection, the NRC inspectors determined that surveillance test procedure (STP) OPT-216, &quot;Remote Shutdown Operability Test&quot; may not be adequate to meet the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR). The STP provided a method to test the transfer of functional control from the Control Room (CR) to the Hot Shutdown Panel (HSP), but may not have provided assurance that a circuit fault affecting control from the HSP would be identified. Engineering personnel (Utility, Non-Licensed) reported the condition to CR personnel (Utility, Licensed) and both units entered TS SR 3.0.3 for the affected components and risk assessments were completed which supported continued operability. E. THE METHOD OF DISCOVERY OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR PROCEDURAL PERSONNEL ERROR On June 18, 2010, during performance of the Component Design Bases Inspection, the NRC inspectors determined that surveillance test procedure (STP) OPT-216, &quot;Remote Shutdown Operability Test&quot; may not be adequate to meet the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR). . </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY·COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURES A. CAUSE OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE Not applicable -No component failures were identified during this event. B. FAILURE MODE, MECHANISM, AND EFFECTS OF EACH FAILED COMPONENT Not applicable -No component failures were identified during this event. C. SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY FAILURE OF COMPONENTS WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS Not applicable -No component failures were identified during this event. D. FAILED COMPONENT INFORMATION Not applicable -No component failures were identified during this event. III. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT A. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED Not applicable -No safety system responses occurred as a result of this event. B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY The current method provided in the STP to test the transfer of functional control from the Control Room (CR) to the Hot Shutdown Panel (HSP) has been utilized since the initial licensing of Unit 1 in 1990 and Unit 2 in 1993. C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT As of the date of this report, engineering reviews have determined that no undetected failures would have existed and the STPs are adequate. However, these reviews are currently ongoing. IV. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The cause of this event is still being determined and a supplemental report providing this information will be submitted by November 16, 2010. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Engineering personnel reported the condition to CR personnel and both units entered TS SR 3.0.3 for the affected components. Risk assessments were completed within 24 hours which supported continued operability. Further corrective actions, if any, will be determined upon completion of the ongoing engineering reviews. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
