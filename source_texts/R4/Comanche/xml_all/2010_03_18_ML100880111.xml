At 1827 hours, during review of an Oconee INPO OEreport, parallels were discovered between the Oconee design and the CPNPP design. Further investigation determined that the required completion times for TS 3.3.2, Condition J, may not have been completed in the past when Units 1 and 2 were operating at low power with only one MFWP providing MFW flow. The cause of this event is still being determined and a supplemental report providing this information will be submitted by May 31,2010. Corrective actions include the completion of procedure changes on Unit 1 to ensure compliance with TS. Since Unit 2 has been operating at 100% power with both MFW pumps in service since discovery of this condition, corresponding changes to the Unit 2 procedures will be completed prior to removing one MFW pump from service during the next shutdown of Unit 2 or prior to startup of Unit 2 from any event which results in an unplanned trip of Unit 2.

REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION 1 OCFR50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B) &quot;Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications&quot; and 1 OCFR50.73(a)(2)(vii) &quot;Any event where a single cause or condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to: (B) Remove residual heat&quot; B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT On January 20,2010, CPNPP Unit 1 was in Mode 3 during a planned outage and Unit 2 was in Mode 1 operating at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO 'THE EVENT There were no inoperable structures, systems, or components that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES CPNPP TS 3.3.2, Function 6.g, requires two Main Feedwater pump (MFWP) trip channels for each automatic Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFW) initiation circuit. TS 3.3.2 also requires a manual initiation circuit, which was not affected by this event. Per TS 3.3.2, Condition J, if one required MFWP trip channel is inoperable, the inoperable trip channel must be placed in the trip condition within 6 hours or the plant must be placed in MODE 3 within the following 12 hours. On JanuarY 20,2010, CPNPP Unit 1 was in Mode 3 during a planned outage and Unit 2 was in Mode 1 operating at 100% power. At 1827 hours, during review of Oconee INPO OE30225 (&quot;Main Feedwater Pump Reset design feature provides incorrect Main .Feedwater Pump status&quot;), a System Engineer (Utility; Non-Licensed) discovered parallels between the Oconee design and the CPNPP design. Further investigation determined that CPNPP operating procedures allowed for one MFWP [EllS: (SJ)(P)] to be reset (Le., hydraulic oil pressure present) but not aligned to be a source of MFW. During low-power plant operations, such as start-up or when Unit 1 was recently operated at a lower power level while a single Main Transformer was in service, only one MFWP is creating forward MFW flow. The other MFWP is in a &quot;reset&quot; condition, with the Steam Stop Valves [EllS: (SJ)(SHV)] open. This condition utilizes hydraulic trip fluid to keep the </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

In the event that the operating MFWP receives a &quot;trip&quot; signal, all of the MFW flow would cease, but since the off-line MFWP is in the &quot;reset&quot; condition, the 2/2 &quot;Loss of Main Feedwater&quot; logic would not be satisfied, and an AFW auto-start signal [EllS: (BA)(MSTR») would not be initiated. It was determined that in this condition, the MFWP trip channel would be inoperable per TS 3.3.2, Condition J. CPNPP believes that this condition has existed since 1990, when Unit 1 was initially licensed. Therefore, the required actions of TS 3.3.2, Condition J, may not have been complied with since 1990 at any time that CPNPP Units 1 and 2 were operating at low power with only one MFWP providing MFWflow. E. THE METHOD OF DISCOVERY OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR PROCEDURAL PERSONNEL ERROR During review of an Oconee INPO OE report, a System Engineer (Utility, Non-licensed) discovered parallels between the Oconee design and the CPNPP design. Further investigation determined that the required completion times for TS 3.3.2, Condition J, may not have been completed in the past within the times specified in the TS. II.

DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY The required actions of TS 3.3.2, Condition J, may not have been complied with since 1990 at any time that CPNPP Units 1 and 2 were operating at low power with only one MFWP providing MFW flow. C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OFTHE EVENT The applicable safety function is decay heat removal via the AFW system. The motordriven AFW pumps are designed to start automatically in the event of a low-low water level in any steam generator, upon actuation of a Safety Injection or AMSAC, after restoration of bus power following a loss of offsite power, or upon trip of both MFWPs. In the safety analyses presented in FSAR Chapter 15, the only credited signal is the start of the motor-driven AFW pumps upon generation of a low-low water level signal in any steam generator. Even though the TS required automatic initiation circuit of the motordriven AFW pumps upon trip of both MFW pumps may not have been operable since 1990 at any time that CPNPP Units 1 and 2 were operating at low power with only one MFWP providing MFW flow, the AFW pumps remained operable. The automatic start of the motor-driven AFW pumps upon trip of both MFWPs is an anticipatory trip based on the loss of normal decay heat removal; this trip function is not credited in the FSAR Chapter 15 accident analyses. Automatic actuation of the Motor Driven AFW pumps was still possible via steam generator low-low water level protection circuits (which, at CPNPP, are credited within the safety analyses), via AMSAC (which starts Turbine Driven and Motor Driven AFW pumps), upon actuation of a Safety Injection signal, and by a blackout signal after restoration of bus power following a loss of offsite power. AFW initiation was also available via manual actuation by control room operators as required by TS 3.3.2. Based on the availability of the motor-driven AFW pump start signal credited in the safety analyses, the unavailability of the anticipatory start signal has no impact on the conclusions of the accident analyses. IV. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The cause of this event is still being determined and a supplemental report providing this information will be submitted by May 31, 2010. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective actions include the completion of procedure changes on Unit 1 to ensure compliance with TS. Since Unit 2 has been operating at 100% power with both MFWPs in service since discovery of this condition, corresponding changes to the Unit 2 procedures will be completed prior to removing one MFWP from service during the next shutdown of Unit 2 or </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A .
