At the time of this discovery, a plant heat-up was in progress in preparation for return to service following a maintenance outage. The oil sample that yielded these Iresults had been drawn on April 25, and shipped off-site for vendor analysis. Plant engineers evaluated the trends of prior lubricating oil samples taken prior to May 8, and determined that the DG had become incapable of performing its design safety function on approximately October 28, 201&quot;j. It was concluded that this date was the likely starting point of the internal fuel leak that contaminated the oil. That fuel leak likely resulted from gasket damage that occurred during work on the fl!el injectors. On May 8,che DG was removed from service in order to change the lubricating oil and repair the fuel leak. It has been determined that, in the as-found condition, the DG remained capable of fulfilling the mission time assumed by the station~s probabilistic risk analysis. Enhanced work instructions for fuel jumper installation have been added to the vendor manual and to model work orders. This condition is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications. \ </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

At the time of this discovery, a plant heat-up was in progress in preparation for return to service following a maintenance outage. The oil sample that yielded these results had been drawn on April 25, and shipped off-site for vendor analysi&amp;. Plant engineers evaluated the trends of prior lubricating oil samples taken prior to May 8, and determined that the DG had become incapable of performing tts design safety function on approximately October 28, 2011. It was concluded that this date was the !ikf;y starting point of the internal fuel leak that contaminated the oil. On May 8, the DG was removed from service in order to change the lubricating oil and repair the fuel leak. This condition is being reported in accordance with 1 OCFR5(),73('J)(2)(i)(8) as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications. INVESTIGATION and CAUSAL ANALYSIS The Division 3 DG is an Electro-Motive Division (EMD) Model No. 2C-645-E4. Many of the fuel system components are located intemally, such thc·;t any fuel leakage wi!! likely migrate to the oil sump. The specified oil viscosity for this engine is 40 weight. Fuel dilution of approximately 5% thins the oil such that the viscosity becomes similar to 30 weight. EMD instructions direct that the engine must not be run with oil contamination greater than 5%. The sample drawn un Ap;-il 25 contained approximately 4.29% fuel. In October 2011, the DG was removed from service for scheduled maintenance, including removal and testing of the fuel injectors. Following re-installation of the injectors, a fuel system leak test confirmed that no leaks were present. After the DG was removed from service on May 8, a ';uelleak was iOUl1d at the jumper-to-filter cap connection on number 20 cylinder. The jumper was replaced, and a leak test was performed. The leak rate was reduced, but was not eliminated. The jumper was again rE;moved. While observing maintenance technicians performing the work, the system engineer directed that the two ends of the jumper be installed in a certain sequence using a specific tEichnique. This technique appeared to cause less binding on the connection at the injecto:'. </TH></TR></Table><P>r </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10=2010) </P><P>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

Only the final torque ;5 specified. The system engineer discussed assembly technique with a vendor representative. The ve; ldof confirmed that it is a good practice to install the fuel line jumpers as the engineer had directed becaus&amp; '~he lead gaskets on each end of the jumper are easily damaged. The vendor suggested that these speCific instructions be added to the model work packagG to minimize the risk of damage to the gaskets. </P><P>This investigation found that the fuel leak was likely ca:.JsecJ by gaske~ damage that occurred during the re-installation of the injectors in October 2011. </P><P>PREViOUS OCCURRENCE EVALUATION </P><P>No similar failure has been reported by River Bend Station in the last fiVe years. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT RECURRENCE </P><P>Enhanced work instructions for fuel jumper installation have been added to the vendor manual and to model </P><P>I </P><P>work orders. </P><P>SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE </P><P>With offsite power available, the high pressure core 3pray system remained capable of performing its safety function. There were no actual events c:lur~ng this period requiring the Division 3 DG to respond in the emergency mode. </P><P>The term &quot;mission time:&quot; is not precisely defined in the r,egulations -it is typically expressed as &quot;for as long as needed&quot;. A 24-hour mission time is assumed for the Division 3 DG in the RBS Probabilistic Risk Analysi,s (PRA), and is specified under the Mitigating Systems PerformancE) Index program for the Division 3DG. </P><P>To evaluate the ability of the DG to fulfill its design function with the as-found fuel leak, a third-party engineering report performec for a nearly identical DG at Clinton station was obtained. This report concluded that the Clinton's DG could have successfully operated at full load with up to 22 percent dilution of the lube oil. Given this conclusion, RBS' site engineers determined that the DG could have operated with the calculated fuel leakage rate for at least 164 hours (6,8 days) at full power before reaching 22 percent dilution. As such, the Division 3 DG could have successfully supported the PRA mission time with significant margin in the as-folind condition. This evant W~S, thus, of minimal safety significance with respect to the health and safety of the public. </P><P>(Note -Energy Industry Component Identification codes are annotated as (**XX**).) </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10=2010) </P><P>~=---------------------------~-------------------~-----=------------------~ </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
