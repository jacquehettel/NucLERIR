This instrument provides a permissive to the reactor protection system (RPS) to enable a reactor scram signal from main turbine control valve control valve fast closure and main turbine stop valve closure. Also enabled by that permissive is a reactor recirculation pump trip signal initiated by the main turbine stop valve closure. While performing the initial troubleshooting, a maintenance technician discovered that a valve at the affected steam pressure transmitter was closed, isolating it from the system. This valve had apparently been left closed following the calibration of the instrument during the outage. The valve was opened, and the instrumentation channel was declared operable at 5:52 p.m. that day. The signals enabled by this pressure transmitter are required to be operable when reactor power is greater than 40 percent. Reactor power had exceeded 40 percent at approximately 3:24 a.m. that day. This event is being reported as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><P>,

This instrument (**PT**) provides a permissive to the reactor protection system (RPS) (JC) to enable a reactor scram signal from main turbine control valve control valve fast closure and main turbine stop valve closure. Also enabled by that permissive is a reactor recirculation pump trip signal initiated by the main turbine stop valve closure. Operators initiated a work order and initiated the appropriate Technical Specification required actions. While performing the initial troubleshooting, a maintenance technician discovered that a valve (**V**) at the affected steam pressure transmitter was closed, isolating it from the system. The valve was opened, and the pressure transmitter was returned to service. The instrumentation channel was declared operable at 5:52 p.m. that day. The reactor scram and reactor recirculation pump trip signals enabled by this pressure transmitter are required to be operable when reactor power is greater than 40 percent. Reactor power had exceeded 40 percent at approximately 3:24 a.m. that day. The inoperability of the &quot;0&quot; RPS instrument channel at the time that its condition of applicability was met constitutes operations prohibited by Technical Specifications, and is being reported in accordance with 1 OCFR50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B). INVESTIGATION and CAUSAL ANALYSIS The investigation of this event found that the affected main turbine first stage pressure transmitter had been calibrated during the outage. A search of other documentation related to danger tagging, system valve alignment checks, etc., found no other opportunity for the positioning of this valve. While the work package for the calibration indicates that the valve had been verified open at the completion of the activity, it is apparent that the valve was actually left closed. The technicians who performed the calibration recalled nothing out of the ordinary about restoring the instrument to service. The apparent cause of this event was inadequate self-checking on the part of the technicians. A potential contributing factor is the unusual number designations for the transmitter isolation and test valves that are different than other similar instruments. Additionally, the calibration procedure addressed the valve by its noun name only, without reference to its mark number. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE EVALUATION No similar events have been reported by River Bend Station in the last five years. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

NO. </TD><TD>3 OF 3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2011 ··002·· 00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>CORRECTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT RECURRENCE The following actions are being documented in the station's corrective action program: • A memorandum was distributed across the site to make personnel aware of the event, and highlight the breakdowns in human performance that caused it. • The affected calibration procedure (and the procedures for the redundant channels) will be revised to add instrument mark numbers to the instructions. • The integrated plant startup procedure has been revised to require the operator to check that this instrumentation is operating properly prior to exceeding 40 percent power. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The mispositioned valve affected only the &quot;D&quot; main turbine first stage pressure instrument and its associated channel. The logic circuit designs of the RPS system and the reactor recirculation pump trip system are such that the other three redundant channels of main turbine control valve control valve fast closure and main turbine stop valve closure instruments would have caused a reactor scram and/or a recirculation pump trip had such an actual event occurred while the &quot;D&quot; channel was inoperable. Thus, this event was of minimal significance to the health and safety of the public.
