The plant was operating at 100 percent power at the time ofthis determination. Negative RPV pressure is not bounded by TS 3.4.11, Reactor Coolant System Pressure and Temperature Limits. As such, this condition constitutes operations prohibited by TS, and is being reported in accordance IOCFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). This condition occurred due to a failure to recognize that a negative RPV pressure is not allowed by the TS. Consequently, the practice was incorporated into the plant startup procedure and operator training. Interim action was taken to modify the use ofthe plant startup procedure. Subsequently, a revision to the procedure was developed and instituted. An engineering determined that the RPV remained within the established material stress margins. The RPV also remained within established margins with regard to brittle fracture of the RPV ferritic materials. As such, this condition was ofminimal significance to the health and safety of the public, </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (01·2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (02-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH><TH>APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3160-0104 EXPIRES: 0113112017 Estimated bUlden per response to oomply with this mandatory oollection request 80 hours.

The plant was operating at 100 percent power at the time of this determination. Negative RPV pressure is not bounded by TS 3.4.11, Reactor Coolant System Pressure and Temperature Limits. As such, this condition constitutes operations prohibited by TS, and is being reported in accordance lOCFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). CAUSAL ANALYSIS This condition occurred due to a failure to recognize that a negative RPV pressure is not allowed by the TS. As a consequence, the practice was incorporated into the plant startup procedure and operator training. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Interim action was taken in the issuance ofan Operations Standing Order to modify the use of the plant startup procedure. Subsequently, a revision to the procedure was developed and instituted. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE An engineering evaluation ofthis condition found that, during the past three years (the period of applicability for this reporting criterion), five plant startups were performed in which the RPV pressure was allowed to become negative, with maximum values ranging from -1 psig to -16 psig. An average pressure of-12 psig was assumed for the purposes of assessing the effects on RPV integrity. The lowest reactor coolant temperature recorded during those startups was l22F. This evaluation determined that the RPV remained within the established material stress margins. The RPV also remained within established margins with regard to brittle fracture of the RPV ferritic materials. As such, this condition was of minimal significance to the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) </P></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
