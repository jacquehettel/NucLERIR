At the time of this discovery, a plant heat-up was in progress in preparation for return to service following a maintenance outage. The oil sample that yielded these results had been drawn on April 28, and shipped off-site for vendor analysis. Plant engineers evaluated the trends of prior lubricating oil samples taken prior to May 8, and determined that the DG had become incapable of running for the full 30 days assumed by its design safety function on approximately October 28, 2011. It was concluded that this date was the likely starting point of the internal fuel leak that contaminated the oil. On May 8, the DG was removed from service in order to change the lubricating oil and repair the fuel leak. The investigation of this event determined that the fuel leak was likely due to gasket damage that occurred during the maintenance outage in October 2011. This condition is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10·2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

At the time of this discovery, a plant heat-up was in progress in preparation for return to service following a maintenance outage. The oil sample that yielded these results had been drawn on April 28, and shipped off-site for vendor analysis. Plant engineers evaluated the trends of prior lubricating oil samples taken prior to May 8, and determined that the DG had become incapable of running for the full 30 days assumed by its design safety function on approximately October 28, 2011. It was concluded that this date was the likely starting point of the internal fuel leak that contaminated the oil. On May 8, the DG was removed from service in order to change the lubricating oil and repair the fuel leak. This condition is being reported in accordance with 1 OCFR50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications. INVESTIGATION and CAUSAL ANALYSIS The Division 3 DG is an Electro-Motive Division (EMD) Model No. 20-645-E4. Many of the fuel system components are located internally, such that any fuel leakage will likely migrate to the oil sump. The speCified oil viscosity for this engine is 40 weight. Fuel dilution of approximately 5% thins the oil such that the viscosity becomes similar to 30 weight. EMD instructions direct that the engine must not be run with oil contamination greater than 5%. The sample drawn on April 25 contained approximately 4.29% fuel. In October 2011, the DG was removed from service for scheduled maintenance, including removal and testing of the fuel injectors. Following re-installation of the injectors, a fuel system visual leak test confirmed that no leaks were present. After the DG was removed from service on May 8, a fuel leak was found at the jumper-to-filter cap connection on number 20 cylinder. The jumper was replaced, and a leak test was performed. The leak rate was reduced, but was not eliminated. The jumper was again removed. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10=2010) NRC FORM 366A (10=2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

NO. </TD><TD>30F3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2012 --001 -00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>While observing maintenance technicians performing the work, the system engineer directed that the two ends of the jumper be installed in a certain sequence using a specific technique. This technique appeared to cause less binding on the connection at the injector, and the leakage was stopped. There is no guidance in any vendor manual that states exactly how to install the fuel line jumper (i.e., which side to install first). Only the final torque is specified. The system engineer' discussed assembly technique with a vendor representative. The vendor confirmed that it is a good practice to install the fuel line jumpers as the engineer had directed because the lead gaskets on each end of the jumper are easily damaged. The vendor suggested that these specific instructions be added to the model work package to minimize the risk of damage to the gaskets. This investigation found that the fuel leak was likely caused by gasket damage that occurred during the re-installation of the injectors in October 2011. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE EVALUATION No similar failure has been reported by River Bend Station in the last five years. CORRECTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT RECURRENCE Enhanced work instructions for fuel jumper installation will be added to the vendor manual and to model work orders. This action is being tracked in the station's corrective action program. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE With offsite power available, the high pressure core spray system remained capable of performing its safety function. There were no actual events during this period requiring the Division 3 DG to respond in the emergency mode. An analysis is being conducted to quantify the risk significance of this event. The results of that analysis will be provided in a supplement to this report. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
