The plant was operating at 100 percent power at the time. Immediately prior to that signal, an apparent malfunction in the main turbine electro-hydraulic control (EHC) system caused both the main turbine steam bypass valves to fully open, and also commanded all four main turbine control valves to close. The resulting increase in reactor steam pressure caused reactor power to immediately rise to the trip setpoint ofthe APRMs, at which point the actuation ofthe reactor protection system (RPS) occurred. After the scram occurred, an operator in the auxiliary control room erroneously removed all the main condensate system demineralizers from service, isolating condensate flow to the suction header ofthe main feedwatel' pumps. The running feedwater pump tripped on low suction pressure. The mis-operation ofthe demineralizer system was promptly corrected, and the mair. feecwater system was restored to service. The cause ofthe EHC malfunction has not been determined. Potential failure points were identified, and those circuitry parts were replaced. A human performance error review was conducted regarding the mis-operation ofthe condensate demineralizers, and appropriate procedure revisions have been made. This event is being reported in accordance with IOCFR50.73(a)(2)(iv) as an automatic actuation of the RPS system. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.s.

The plant was operating at 100 percent power at the time. Immediately prior to that signal, an apparent malfunction in the main turbine electro-hydraulic control (EHC) (**n**) system caused both the main turbine steam bypass valves to fully open, and also commanded all four main turbine control valves to close. The resulting increase in reactor steam pressure caused reactor power to immediately rise to the trip setpoint ofthe APRMs, at which point the actuation ofthe reactor protection system (RPS) (**JC**) occurred. All reactor control rods inserted as designed in response to the RPS actuation, and operators implemented the appropriate response procedures. After the scram occurred, an operator in the auxiliary control room erroneously removed all the main condensate system demineralizers (**SF**) from service, isolating condensate flow to the suction header ofthe main feedwater pumps (**SJ**). The &quot;C&quot; feedwater pump tripped on low suction pressure; the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; feedwater pumps had been previously secured by the operators. The mis-operation ofthe demineralizer system was promptly recognized and corrected, and the main feedwater system was restored to service within approximately six minutes. In the interim, reactor water level decreased to Level 3, causing a second actuation ofthe RPS system, but remained well above the point at which actuation ofthe emergency core cooling systems is required. The Level 3 signal also caused an automatic actuation of the containment isolation valves in the suppression pool cooling system, as designed. Reactor recirculation pump &quot;B&quot; failed to downshift to slow speed, and instead, tripped off. A controlled plant cooldown was commenced, and proceeded into cold shutdown conditions. This event is being reported in accordance with IOCFRSO.73(a)(2)(iv) as an automatic actuation ofthe RPS system. INVESTIGATION and IMMEDIATE ACTIONS 1. EHC Malfunction An investigation team was formed to analyze the operating parameters ofthe EHC system and determine the source ofthe malfunction. Earlier in that same shift, there were two actuations of the main control room alarm indicating that the turbine steam bypass valves were open. At 7:26 p.m., the alarm actuated and immediately cleared. Plant computer data indkated that both bypass valves had opened slightly, while the number 4 turbine control valve closed slightly .. No accompanying changes were noted in reactor pressure or in any EHC parameters. At 11:14 p.m., the alarm actuated a second time. Computer data then showed that turbine bypass valve no. I had fully opened, and bypass valve no. 2 had opened approximately 20 percent. Turbine control valve no. 4 closed significantly, and there was a slight change in the turbine steam flow reference signal in the EHC system. Analysis of EHC parameters immediately prior to the scram found that the steam flow reference signal went from 92 perr.ent to negative 41 percent with no corresponding change in total steam flow demand. The error in the steam flow reference signal cleared in approximately five seconds, but the resulting pressure transient had caused the reactor scram by that point. The movements of the bypass valves and turbine control valves were appropriate for the loss ofthe steam flow reference signal. A detailed circuit analysis was performed to identify which components within the system could cause the loss ofthis signal. Efforts to recreate the loss of the signal were unsuccessful. Based on the system response earlier in the shift, and the lack of any apparent fault, it was concluded that an intermittent failure with the steam flow reference signal was occurring. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) </P><P>•

Discussion with the vendor concerning the load limit and load set runback card concluded that its potential role as a source of the failure was extremely low. Ifa definite Cause ofthe EHC malfunction is found, that information will be provided in a supplement to this report. 2. Mis-operation ofthe main feedwater system When the operators in the auxiliary control room heard the plant announcement of a reactor scram, they began removing main condensate deminemlizers from service to maintain proper system parameters for the expected decrease in feedwater flow. However, they inappropriately isolated all the demineralizers, isolating all flow to the main feedwater pump suction header. Main control room opemtors had already secured two ofthe three pumps; the last pump tripped on low suction pressure. The error was promptly recognized, and deminemlizers were restored to service, allowing the re-start ofa feedwater pump. A human performance error review was conducted, which found the following: • The auxiliary control room opemtors did not correctly follow the system operating procedure guidance on maintaining flow though individual deminemlizers within specifications as overall system flow decreased. The operators imposed unnecessary haste by focusing on demineralizer channeling effects, and did not demonstrate knowledge of integmted system opemtion. • Proceduml guidance for the removal ofcondensate deminemlizers from service following a scram was less than adequate, in that it promoted the practice that opemtors in the field have the authority to determine when they can perform actions without specific direction from the main control room. • Opemtions department management had not clearly defined standards and expectations to preclude auxiliary operators from taking actions without direction from main control room operators, or a supervisor, during certain plant conditions. In this event, the condensate deminemlizers were removed from service and then returned to service without direction from main control room, with the intent of not distracting those opemtors from the scmm recovery. The system opemting procedure promotes this long-standing practice. CORRECTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT RECURRENCE 1. EHC malfunction During the upcoming refueling outage in February 2015, an evaluation ofa potential replacement ofthe obsolete card will b::: completed. A complete replacement with a digital EHC system is planned for the refueling outage to occur in early 2017. These actions are being tracked in the corrective action program. </TH></TR></Table><P>'.

Mis-operation ofthe main condensate demineralizer system The system operating procedure for the main condensate demineralizers has been revised to clarify the precautions regarding how many demineralizers are to remain in service. The scram respons~ procedure has been revised to add a step for the main control room operators to communicate with the auxiliary control room operator regarding system operations, PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE EV ALUA nON No event reported by RBS within the last three years was caused by unexplained, erratic signals originating within the main turbine EHC control circuits. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE At the time ofthe reactor scram, the reactor core isolation cooling system was out of service for planned maintenance. No plant parameters that would have required its actuation were exceeded. No other engineered safety features were out of service at the time. The plant response to this transient was as designed. Thus, this event was ofminimal significance to the health and safety ofthe public.
