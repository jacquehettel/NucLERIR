Leakage was indicated by a small amount of dry boron on the lower portion of the nozzle bore with rust stains on the Alloy 600 nozzle and in the vicinity surrounding the nozzle outlet. Subsequent inspections and evaluation revealed minor corrosion of the nozzle bore and concluded that the failure mechanism for the degradation was Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of Alloy 600 material. A planned mitigation repair method for the affected nozzle was implemented to resolve this condition.  Also, in accordance with Arkansas Nuclear One’s Inservice Inspection program, the remaining 8 pressurizer nozzles were visually inspected and exhibited no indications of leakage or degradation.  During the refueling outage, all 9 pressurizer instrument nozzles were replaced with materials that are resistant to PWSCC.  The pressurizer nozzles with dissimilar metal butt welds (surge, spray, and safety valve nozzles) had previously been mitigated by a full structural weld overlay. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Plant Status At the time this condition was discovered, Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1) was shutdown in Mode 6 for a scheduled refueling outage. B. Event Description On March 27, 2010, during a scheduled visual examination, an Entergy examiner noted conditions indicative of corrosion and a through wall leak on an ANO-1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] pressurizer [PZR] level tap nozzle.  This is 1 of 9 pressurizer instrument penetrations that contained Alloy 600 materials.  The leakage was indicated by a small trail of what appeared to be dry boron on the lower portion of the nozzle bore accompanied by rust stains on the Alloy 600 nozzle and the insulation cut-out around the nozzle.  The affected nozzle is located in the upper section (steam space) of the pressurizer. On March 31, 2010, upon completion of initial machining to remove a portion of the original nozzle to a depth of 2 1/8 inches from the outside diameter (OD) of the pressurizer shell, a visual inspection was performed.  This depth is the design boring depth for the installation of a new half nozzle. The inspection revealed minor wastage of the pressurizer carbon steel at the 270 degree position (with zero degrees at top dead center, increasing in a clockwise direction when looking from the outside of the pressurizer) and evidence of general corrosion in the annulus between the bore and the nozzle remnant.  A decision was made to bore an additional 1/2 inch, which was the maximum capable depth allowed by the installed Foreign Material Exclusion (FME) plug. A visual and boroscopic examination of the bore revealed similar corrosion and wastage.  Accordingly, additional nozzle removal was performed to determine the extent of this corrosion. A shorter length FME plug was installed that allowed removal of the original nozzle to a depth of 5 inches.  This permitted further inspections (on April 3 and April 4, 2010) confirming that there is no structurally significant wastage. The assessment of the extent of corrosion in the affected nozzle conservatively estimated the total volume of material loss is 0.43 cubic inches.  This value assumes a nominal 0.06 inch depth of material loss over 30 percent of the surface area of the bore.  The diameter of the bore is 1.455 inches and the depth is 5 inches.  The maximum depth of corrosion in the radial direction with respect to the bore/penetration axis was estimated to be 0.10 inches, which was at the original 270 degree location at the 2 inch bore depth. There was no evidence of leakage identified in the remaining 8 pressurizer nozzles. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Cause The original installed pressurizer nozzle materials are comprised of Inconel Alloy 600 and weld material 82/182. These Inconel materials are susceptible to Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC). The type of leakage noted (boron trails and rust stains) is indicative of this type of degradation. Further examination and evaluation of the affected nozzle determined that the cause was due to through wall PWSCC of either the nozzle material or the J-weld material. The wastage present in the bore of the pressurizer penetration was due to the corrosive environment that developed as a result of the leakage.  The wastage consists of general area corrosion with local areas of pitting. Most of the corrosion identified is limited to the bottom half of the bore.  The localized pitting is random and does not appear to be a result of damage mechanisms amplified by high velocity flow rates, such as flow accelerated corrosion or jet impingement erosion.  The primary damage mechanism appears to be oxidation of the carbon steel base metal due to the presence of moisture and air, with localized pitting of small areas.  D. Corrective Actions The affected nozzle was replaced along with the remaining 8 other small bore nozzles on the pressurizer.  As part of the Alloy 600 mitigation program, all 9 pressurizer nozzles had been scheduled for replacement during this refueling outage and were replaced with materials that are resistant to PWSCC (Inconel materials Alloy 690 and weld metal 52/152).  An engineering evaluation of the nozzle bore corrosion where the leakage occurred was performed with regard to the structural qualification of the pressurizer vessel.  The modified geometry of the replacement nozzle, the OD pad, and the associated welds were evaluated to determine if the corrosion must be repaired or to determine if the condition was acceptable for continued service as-is.  The modified geometry was the result of excavating the existing nozzle deeper than originally designed and a slightly increased nozzle diameter.  The evaluation report calculated an ASME Code allowable bore diameter in the pressurizer of 3.34 inches.  With a maximum corrosion depth of approximately 0.10 inches, the corrosion is well within the Code allowable. Additionally, the half-nozzle repair meets the primary stress requirements of the ASME Code, Section III. E. Safety Significance Evaluation Examinations and evaluation of the affected nozzle have characterized the corrosion as minor.  There was minimal base material wastage to the pressurizer nozzle area.  Additionally, a nozzle repair method has been qualified and accepted which leaves the flaw contained in the original ID weld and the nozzle remnant in place.  </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Safety Significance Evaluation - continued During the previous operating cycle, there were no indications of degradation.  RCS total leakage prior to shutdown for the refueling outage was stable, with a maximum RCS total leak rate for the month of March 2010 of 0.285 gallons per minute (gpm).  The unidentified leak rate measured on March 21, 2010 immediately prior to shutdown for refueling was 0.028 gpm.  These values are well within the Technical Specification RCS leak rate limits. While the contribution from the nozzle flaw cannot be specifically quantified, the unidentified leak rate measurement above provides a bounding value.  For these reasons, the overall safety significance of this condition was determined to be minimal. F. Basis for Reportability Using the guidance from NUREG-1022, “Event Reporting Guidelines – 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73”, Section 3.2.4, the discovered condition was considered a serious degradation of a principal safety barrier.  Accordingly, on March 27, 2010, an immediate notification was made to the NRC Operations Center in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A).  The report herein is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A). G.
