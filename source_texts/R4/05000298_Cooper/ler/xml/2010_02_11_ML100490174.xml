ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On December 21, 2009, Cooper Nuclear Station Control Room Operators started the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) auxiliary oil pump in support of obtaining an oil sample for the predictive maintenance oil analysis program. Immediately following the start of the auxiliary oil pump, the Control Room Operator observed that the HPCI governor valve did not respond as expected. The HPCI auxiliary oil pump was operated a second time and the governor valve did not operate at all. As a result, HPCI was declared inoperable at 13:37, Central Standard Time (CST), resulting in entry into Technical Specification Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.5.1 Condition C, and LCO 3.3.3.2 Condition A. Preliminary results of the troubleshooting activities determined that the malfunctioning governor valve could be a result of binding in the electro-hydraulic controller (EG-R). The EG-R has been sent to an offsite laboratory for analysis. The cause of the event will be provided in a supplemental report after the results of the analysis have been reviewed. This event was determined to be reportable as a loss of safety function. Actual nuclear safety significance is minimal due to the fact that no events occurred which required HPCI to be initiated. HPCI was declared operable at 16:45 CST on December 24, 2009. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) NRC FORM 366A (9-20071 NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) NRC FORM 366A (9-20071 </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of Form 366A) PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at 100% power at the time of discovery. BACKGROUND The High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System (EIIS:BJ) provides protection to the core for the case of a small break in the reactor coolant pressure boundary which does not result in rapid depressurization of the reactor vessel. The HPCI System permits the nuclear plant to be shutdown while maintaining sufficient reactor vessel water inventory until the reactor vessel is depressurized. The HPCI System continues to operate until reactor vessel pressure is below the pressure at which Low Pressure Coolant Injection (EIIS:BO) operation or Core Spray System (EIIS:BM) operation can be used to maintain core cooling. HPCI consists of a steam turbine assembly (EIIS:TRB) driving a multi-stage booster and main pump assembly (EIIS:P) and system piping, valves, controls and instrumentation. The HPCI turbine is driven by steam from the reactor which is generated by decay and residual heat. A control governor receives a HPCI flow signal and adjusts the turbine steam control valve so that HPCI design pump discharge flow rate is obtained. The flow signal used for automatic control of the turbine is derived from a differential pressure measurement across a flow element in the HPCI pump discharge pipeline. The governor controls the pressure applied to the hydraulic operator of the turbine control valve, which, in turn, controls the steam flow to the turbine. Upon receipt of the actuation signal, the auxiliary oil pump starts, providing hydraulic pressure for the turbine stop valve and turbine control valve hydraulic operator. The flow signal will ramp the control governor until rated flow is achieved.. As hydraulic oil pressure is developed, the turbine stop valve and the turbine control valve open simultaneously and the turbine accelerates toward the speed setting of the control governor. As HPCI flow increases, the flow signal adjusts the control governor setting so that design flow is maintained. EVENT DESCRIPTION On December 21, 2009, in support of obtaining an oil sample for the predictive maintenance oil analysis program, Control Room Operators started the HPCI auxiliary oil pump. Immediately following the start of the auxiliary oil pump, the Control Room Operator observed that the HPCI governor valve did not respond as expected. Expected response is for the valve to open and close due to pressurization of the oil header, and then ramp and stay open in response to the electronic demand signal. However, the Control Room Operator observed the governor valve position indication and noted that the valve opened, closed, and remained closed. The auxiliary oil pump was then operated for a second time and the governor valve did not operate at all. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of Form 366A) Consequently, HPCI was declared inoperable at 13:37 Central Standard Time (CST), resulting in entry into Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.1 Condition C, ECCS -Operating, HPCI System inoperable; and LCO 3.3.3.2 Condition A, Alternate Shutdown System, One or more required Functions inoperable; and an 8-hour report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations Center was made (Event Notification 45584). Troubleshooting activities were initiated and no degradation of the electronic control signal was found. However, the electro-hydraulic controller (EG-R) was not properly porting oil to allow positioning of the governor valve. The EG-R and the remote servo were replaced upon this discovery. During the troubleshooting, it was found that the HPCI oil filter south canister had the top portion of the filter voided of oil and corrosion products were found on the canister and element. Immediate corrective actions, in addition to replacement of the EG-R and associated remote servo, were to inspect the tubing between the EG-R and associated remote servo. The condition of the tubing was found to be acceptable. The HPCI hydraulic oil filter canisters were cleaned and the disposable filters were replaced. The hydraulic oil was circulated through the oil filters for two hours to flush and clean oil in the system. ' Interim actions have been put in place to perform sampling of the hydraulic oil on the inlet and outlet of the filters, as well as filter inspections, every two weeks to ensure that the oil supplied to the hydraulic controls is within acceptable levels of particulate and moisture. Based on the actions completed during troubleshooting activities and compensatory actions put into place, Operations declared the HPCI System operable at 16:45 CST on December 24, 2009. The EG-R has been sent to an offsite laboratory for analysis. Results of the analysis are expected by April 30, 2010; thus a supplemental report will be submitted after the results of the analysis are reviewed. BASIS FOR REPORT The HPCI System is a single train system. This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as &quot;any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to ... (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; The event was reported as Event Notification Number 45584. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Industrial and personnel safety were not impacted by this event. Nuclear safety was impacted from the standpoint that the HPCI System is relied upon to mitigate a spectrum of small line break accidents as well as assist in maintaining reactor inventory during the initial stages of a station blackout. The potential for these accidents existed when the governor valve degradation was discovered. Thus, this event is significant from the standpoint of degradation of the credited HPCI System. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-20071 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of Form 366A) Actual nuclear safety significance was minimal from the standpoint that no events occurred that relied upon HPCI initiation. This is a Safety System Functional Failure. CAUSE Results of the root cause evaluation will be provided in a supplemental report after results of the laboratory analysis have been reviewed. CORRECTIVE ACTION Corrective actions will be provided in a supplemental report after results of the laboratory analysis have been reviewed. PREVIOUS EVENTS A review of CNS Licensee Event Reports (LER) from 2006 to present revealed that there was one other occurrence related to a loss of safety function due to HPCI being declared inoperable. On February 7,2007, HPCI inverter circuit failure alarms were received intermittently indicating a loss of the inverter output. The failure was the result of an intermittent open circuit in the inverter caused by corrosion which resulted from solder flux residue remaining on copper conductors during the manufacturing process. The event was reported under LER 2007-001, dated April 5, 2007, with a supplemental report, LER 2007-001-01, submitted on May 23,2007. </TH></TR></Table><P>ATTACHMENT 3 LIST OF REGULATORY COMMITMENTS©4
