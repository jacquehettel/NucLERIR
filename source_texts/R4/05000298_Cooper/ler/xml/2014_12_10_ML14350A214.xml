BACKGROUND The purpose of the standby (emergency) Alternating Current (AC) power system [EIIS:EK] is to provide a single failure proof source of on-site AC power adequate for maintaining the safe shutdown of the reactor following abnormal operational transients and postulated accidents. This system consists of two independent AC power sources, the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EIIS:DG]. Each DG shall be capable of automatic start at any time and capable of continued operation at rated load, voltage, and frequency until manually stopped. During normal plant operations, both DGs are in standby. A DG starts automatically on a loss of coolant accident signal (Le., low reactor water level signal or high drywell pressure) or on loss of voltage on a critical bus. The DG automatically connects to its respective bus after off-site power is tripped as a consequence of critical bus loss of voltage or degraded voltage. CNS Technical Specifications (TS) requires that two EDGs be operable when the plant is in Modes 1, 2 or 3, and that one DG be operable when the plant is in Modes 4 or 5, or during movement of irradiated fuel assemblies in the secondary containment. EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 13, 2014, during the performance of the monthly operability test on DG2, an oil leak on the southeast corner of the DG2 engine was observed. Upon further investigation, the right bank camshaft thrust bearing cover bolting was found loose or missing resulting in a lube oil leak from the loose bearing cover. The event is currently under investigation. CNS will provide additional event details, the safety significance, cause evaluation, and corrective action(s) to reduce the probability of recurrence in a supplement to this Licensee Event Report. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC u.s.

Therefore, the event is being conservatively reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8), as &quot;any operation or condition which was prohibited by Technical Specifications&quot; and conservatively reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v), as &quot;any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to ... (0) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; Other criteria, if determined to be applicable, will be provided in the supplemental report. PREVIOUS EVENTS On October 7,2013, OG1 was discovered to have a crack in the liner wall near the top of the 1-Left cylinder liner, which allowed jacket water to leak into the engine lubrication oil. Subpar mechanical properties of the liner caused the crack. This event was reported under LER 2014-002-00, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8) as, &quot;any operation or condition which was prohibited by Technical Specifications&quot; and reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as &quot;any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to ...(0) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; On April 11 ,2012, OG1 failed to start after performance of on-line maintenance activities. The failure was due to improper installation of a starting air distributor rotor in October 2011. This was reported under LER 2012-002-00, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8) as &quot;an operation or a condition which was prohibited by Technical Specifications&quot; and also in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as &quot;any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to ...(0) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
