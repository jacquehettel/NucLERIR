BACKGROUND On December 13, 2013, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 2, &quot;Dispositioning Boiling Water Reactor Licensee Noncompliance with Technical Specification Containment Requirements During Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel.&quot; EGM 11-003, Revision 2, provides generic enforcement discretion to allow implementation of specific interim actions as an alternative to full compliance with plant technical specifications related to secondary containment operability during Mode 5 Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV) activities. To ensure compliance with interim actions specified in the EGM, CNS added guidance to plant procedure 0.50.5, Outage Shutdown Safety. EVENT DESCRIPTION During Refueling Outage 28 (RE-28), CNS implemented the guidance of EGM 11-003, Revision 2, seven times. Consistent with EGM 11-003, Revision 2, secondary containment operability was not maintained during OPDRV activities, and Required Action C.2 of Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1 was not completed. The following list provides the dates which EGM 11-003 was implemented (Note: All times are Central Daylight Time): Start End October 3,2014, at 1602 October 4, 2014, at 1059 October 3,2014, at 2215 October 4,2014, at 0251 October 16, 2014, at 0023 October 22,2014, at 0425 October 16, 2014, at 0437 October 18, 2014, at 0424 Activity Performed Draining Reactor Recirculation Pump [EllS: P] (RR-P) B without the jet pump plugs fully installed Control Rod Drive (CRD) [EllS: AA] maintenance Removal of jet pump plugs associated with RR-P-B maintenance Venting the CRDs (table continued) </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366 02-2014) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION / ....~.'!\ (~) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) (See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) </TH><TH>APPROVED BYOMB: NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE As discussed in EGM 11-003, Revision 2, enforcement discretion is appropriate because the issues have low safety significance since licensees must implement compensatory measures to provide an adequate level of safety when using the discretion. To ensure compliance with the interim actions specified in the EGM, CNS added guidance to plant procedure 0.50.5. This procedure was implemented for the OPDRV activities during which secondary containment was not operable. CAUSE Implementation of EGM 11-003, Revision 2, during RE-28 was a planned activity. As such, there were no root cause evaluations of the events. CORRECTIVE ACTION CNS will submit a license amendment request to adopt the Technical Specifications Task Force (TSTF) traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue, within 12 months after issuance of the Notice of Availability of the TSTF traveler. PREVIOUS EVENTS There have been no events reported in the last three years related to EGM 11-003 or OPDRVs. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
