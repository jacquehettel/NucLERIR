NARRATIVE PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, 100% power, at the time of discovery. BACKGROUND Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) [EIIS:BJ, BM, BO] are designed to limit fuel clad temperature over the complete spectrum of possible break sizes in the reactor coolant pressure boundary including the design basis break which is defined as the complete and instantaneous circumferential rupture of the largest pipe connected to the reactor vessel with displacement of the ends so that blowdown occurs from both ends. The Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) [EIIS:BO] system is one of four systems that make up the ECCS. LPCI provides protection to the core for the case of a large break in the reactor coolant pressure boundary when level cannot be maintained and reactor vessel rapidly depressurizes. Protection extends to a small break in which the High Pressure Coolant Injection [EIIS:BJ] system is unable to maintain reactor water level and the Automatic Depressurization System [EIIS:RV] has operated to lower reactor vessel pressure. LPCI is one operational Mode of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) [EIIS:BO] system. The RHR system provides core cooling, in conjunction with other ECCS sub-systems and also provides containment cooling as required during abnormal operational transients and postulated accidents. . EVENT DESCRIPTION During Refueling Outage 26 (RE26), at 20:42 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on May 7,2011, RHR LPCI &quot;B&quot; was declared inoperable for Suppression Pool Cooling and torus water transfer. As a result, Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.1, ECCS -Operating, Condition A, was entered. On May 8, 2011, the reactor mode switch was placed in &quot;RUN&quot; and Mode 1 was entered at 12:30 CDT. On May 9, 2011, RHR LPCI &quot;B&quot; was declared operable at 00:33 CDT, and TS LCO 3.5.1, Condition A, was exited. On June 13, 2011, while reviewing a post Refueling Outage 26 (RE26) report, it was discovered that TS LCO 3.0.4.b was not complied with during startup from RE26, in that a risk assessment was not performed prior to entering Mode 1. TS LCO 3.0.4.b states, in part, &quot;When an LCO is not met, entry into a MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability shall only be made: ..... b.

NARRATIVE determination of the acceptability of entering the MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability, and establishment of risk management actions, if appropriate; .... &quot; After identifying the condition, verification was made that RHR LPCI &quot;8&quot; subsystem was operating in Suppression Pool Cooling Mode at the time of Mode change. As an interim action, a standing order was created that directs reviewing tracking systems to ensure that no conditions preventing entry into the desired Mode or condition exists. An extent of condition review was performed of startups from previous outages for similar events. One event was discovered during startup from RE23, on November 22, 2006, in which Mode 1 was entered while RHR LPCI &quot;8&quot; was inoperable and aligned with Suppression Pool Cooling. Although the current risk evaluation requirement did not exist at that time, TS LCO 3.0.4 did not allow transitioning into a Mode or other specified condition without meeting the applicable LCOs. 8ASIS FOR REPORT This event is being reported as an operation or condition prohibited by plant TS per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8). SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The overall risk significance of this event is low. The RHR &quot;8&quot; system was operating in Suppression Pool Cooling Mode and capable of being realigned to LPCI Mode if required. Although the LPCI Mode of RHR was considered inoperable, components aligned for Suppression Pool Cooling automatically re-align to LPCI upon receipt of a LPCI initiation signal. In addition, the RHR &quot;A&quot; system was available to perform its design function. Consequently, the safety significance is negligible. CAUSE CNS determined the root cause to be a deficient procedure that does not prompt operations to review all methods of LCO tracking to ensure that LPCI system LCOs related to Suppression Pool Cooling activities are closed prior to changing from Mode 2 to Mode 1. CORRECTIVE ACTION To prevent recurrence of this event, CNS will revise the applicable procedure to prompt operations to check all LCO tracking methods for open LCOs prior to transitioning from Mode 2 to Mode 1. PREVIOUS EVENTS There have been no events reported in the last 3 years related to non-compliance with TS LCO 3.0.4 during plant startups from outages. </TH></TR></Table><P>ATTACHMENT 3 LIST OF REGULATORY COMMITMENTS©4
