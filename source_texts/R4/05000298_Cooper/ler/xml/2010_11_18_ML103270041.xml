EDG2 was inoperable to support draining of the jacket water system. Door N1 03 is rated as a Steam Exclusion Barrier (SEB) door on the Turbine Building side of EDG1 room. With Door N1 03 propped open, if a main steam line rupture were to occur in the Turbine Building, the steam could enter EDG1 room through the prqpped open door, which may affect operability of EDG1. This resulted in an unanalyzed condition, as the EDG rooms had not been evaluated or analyzed for a High Energy Line Break. With EDG2 already declared inoperable for planned maintenance, having EDG1 inoperable creates a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of the EDGs. The root cause of this event was that impairment of Door N1 03 (a SEB door) for maintenance activities was evaluated using procedural guidance based upon a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) rather than performing an operability evaluation. Corrective Actions are established to develop training that explains and clarifies when PRA can be used and when PRA cannot be used. This event was not risk significant. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10:2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operations, at 100% power at the time of discovery. BACKGROUND The purpose of the standby (emergency) Alternating Current (AC) power system [EllS: EK] is to provide a single failure proof source of on-site AC power adequateJor maintaining the safe shutdown of the reactor following abnormal operational transients and postulated accidents. This system consists of two independent AC power sources, the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EllS: DG]. Each EDG shall be capable of automatic start at any time and. capable of continued operation at rated load, voltage, and frequency until manually stopped. Each EDG is housed in completely independent, separated rooms, together with respective auxiliary systems which are provided independently in all respects for each unit. The rooms are connected by doors [EllS: DR] which are nonlouvered, steel doors. Each EDG room is designed as a Class I Seismic building. CNS Technical Specifications require that two EDGs be op~rable when the plant is in Modes 1, 2, or 3, and that one DG be operable when the plant is in Modes 4 or 5. I EVENT DESCRIPTION On August 19, 2010, at 10:05, Central Daylight Time (CDT), both EDG Doors N103and N104 were propped open in support of planned maintenance on EDG2, which had been declared inoperable. The doors were propped open to allow a hose to run from the Turbine Building through EDG1 room and into EDG2 room to support draining ofthe EDG2 jacket water system. Door N1 03 is a Steam Exclusion Barrier (SEB) rated door located on the Turbine Building side of EDG1 room. If a main steam line rupture were to occur in the Turbine Building, the steam could enter EDG1 room through the propped open Door N1 03.. At the time of the event, Operations determined EDG1 system to be operable based on existing guidance documents. These existing guidance documents allowed for compensatory actions to be put in place to assure operability of EDG1 when Door N103 is left open. As a compensatory measure, per guidance documents in place at that time, a Security Officer was posted on the Turbine Building side of Door N 103 to pull the hose and close the door in the event of steam leakage from the Turbine Building. Doors N103 and N104'were closed at 11:10 CDT upon completion of draining EDG2 jacket water system. Based on initial review of the CNS Environmental Qualification Program Basis Document, Section 3.3.2.4.2, completed on September 21,2010, the EDG rooms had not been evaluated or analyzed for a High Energy Line Break environment; therefore, with DoorN103 propped </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) NRC FORM 366A (9·2007) NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

NARRATIVE open, the plant was in an unanalyzed condition that had the potential to degrade plant safety. Consequently, new information concerning the basis for the guidance documents was made available and Operations conservatively determined that by having Door N1 03 propped open, reasonable assurance was lost that the EDG1 would fulfill its safety function. Prior to this event, the issue of door impairments had been periodically documented in notifications and conditions reports. However, they were consistently dispositioned using Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) evaluations. Consequently, CNS guidance documents dealing with the temporary impairment of SEB boundary doors were based upon the incorrect method of PRA, which also contained a latent presumption of operability. These guidance documents were then provided to the Operations staff for execution. At anytime work was planned in accordance with these guidance documents, the EDGs were inadvertently inoperable whenever Door N1 03 was propped open during Modes 1, 2, or 3. BASIS FOR REPORT This event is being reported as an operation or condition that resulted in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B); and also as an eventor condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The safety significance associated with this condition is considered negligible. The potential impact of this condition is limited to pipe breaks outside of cOhtainment. Therefore, EDG1 was available to respond to all other events during the short duration in which EDG2 was inoperable and Door N103 was open. There was no other impact to structures, systems or components that were needed to achieve safe shutdown, or mitigate potential accidents, transients and special events described in the Update Safety Analysis Report. The likelihood of occurrence of pipe breaks outside of containment during the time Door N1 03 was open resulted in a negligible increase to the core damage frequency reflected in the CNS PRA model. This event is a safety system functional failure. CAUSE The root cause of the event was that impairment of Door N1 03 (a SEB door) for maintenance activities was evaluated using procedural guidance based upon a PRA rather than performing an operability evaluation. . </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE CORRECTIVE ACTION The procedure was revised to include specific guidance regarding the operability statements for impaired SEB doors. The following corrective actions are being tracked in the Corrective Action Program and are not regulatory commitments: • Training materials will be prepared for Shift Technical Engineers and Senior Reactor Operators use that explains and clarifies when PRA can be used, and when the assessments cannot be used. Additionally, training will be delivered to an identified target population in Engineering to recognize the limitation of using PRA. • In addition, an evaluation of the effects of a High Energy Line Break on the environment in the EDG rooms will be performed. PREVIOUS EVENTS There have been no events reported in the last three years related to SEB doors. </TH></TR></Table><P>I· ATTACHMENT 3 LIST OF REGULATORY COMMITMENTS©4 </P><P>ATTACHMENT 3 LIST OF REGULATORY COMMITMENTS©' </P><P>Correspondence Number: NLS2010094 </P><P>The following table identifies those actions committed to by Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) in this document.
