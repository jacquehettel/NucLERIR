As a result, oil was added to the reservoir and SWBP B was concluded to be operable. On April 27, 2011, the outboard oiler reservoir was discovered empty. Further investigation found that mounting bolts on the outboard motor bearing were loose causing a less-thanadequate seal between the machined surfaces of the outboard motor bearing housing halves. This inadequate seal had the potential to cause excessive oil usage in the outboard motor bearing. After the oil was replenished on April 17, 2011, SWBP B was used during shutdown cooling until April 27, 2011, losing oil over the period of operation. SWBP B was subsequently declared inoperable and may have been inoperable since July 2010, when the SWBP B motor was installed. This event is currently under investigation.

NARRATIVE PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the event. BACKGROUND The Residual Heat Removal [EIIS:BO] Service Water Booster (RHRSWB) System is designed to provide cooling water for the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System heat exchangers [EIIS:HX], required for a safe reactor shutdown following a Design Basis Accident or transient. The RHRSWB System is operated whenever the RHR heat exchangers are required to operate in the shutdown cooling or suppression pool cooling mode. The system is initiated manually from the control room. If operating during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), the system is automatically tripped to allow the diesel generators [EIIS:DG] to automatically power only that equipment necessary to reflood the core. The system is assumed in the analyses to be manually started 10 minutes after the LOCA. The RHRSWB System removes heat from the suppression pool via the RHR System to limit the suppression pool temperature and primary containment [EIIS:NH] pressure following a LOCA. This ensures that the primary containment can perform its function of limiting the release of radioactive materials to the environment following a LOCA. The analyses assume that the RHRSWB System will provide adequate cooling support to the equipment required for safe shutdown. These analyses include the evaluation of the long term primary containment response after a design basis LOCA. EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 17, 2011, the outboard oiler reservoir [EIIS:RVR] for Service Water Booster Pump (SWBP) B motor [EIIS:MO] was observed to be low, and there was an oil sheen on the floor and motor. As a result, oil was added to the reservoir and SWBP B was concluded to be operable. On April 27,2011, the outboard oiler reservoir was discovered empty. Further investigation found that the outboard bearing housing cover mounting bolts were loose causing a less-thanadequate seal between the machined surfaces of the bearing housing halves, potentially causing excessive oil usage in the outboard motor bearing. After the oil was replenished on April 17, 2011, SWBP B was used during shutdown cooling until April 27, 2011, losing oil over the period of operation. SWBP B was subsequently declared inoperable and may have been inoperable since July 2010, when the SWBP B motor was installed. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-20101 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE This event is currently under investigation. CNS will provide additional event details, the safety significance, root cause, and corrective action(s) to prevent recurrence in a supplement to this Licensee Event Report. BASIS FOR REPORT This event is being reported as an operation or condition prohibited by plant Technical Specifications per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), because the SWBP B was potentially inoperable since July 2010. PREVIOUS EVENTS There have been no events reported in the past three years related to the SWBP B motor. </TH></TR></Table><P>ATTACHMENT 3 LIST OF REGULATORY COMMITMENTS©4
