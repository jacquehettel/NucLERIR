SUBJECT: NRC INSPECTION REPORT 50-397/96-18AND NOTICE OF VIOLATION Dear Mr. Parrish: On November 18-22, 1996, the NRC conducted a team inspection at your Washington Nuclear Project-2 reactor facility. This inspection evaluated your implementation of the requirements of 10 CFR 50.65, "Requirements for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power plants" [the Maintenance Rule]. The enclosed report presents the scope and results of that inspection. Following the inspection, an exit meeting was held to provide the inspection findings to you and your staff. On January 2, 1997, Mr. P. R. Bemis, Vice President of Nuclear Operations, submitted a letter with additional information related to the potential violations and weaknesses identified during the inspection. Consequently, your submittal was reviewed in our office by members of the inspection team. A second telephonic exit was held on January 16, 1997, to inform your staff of the results of our review of the additional information you provided. Our inspection found that your program for implementing the requirements of the Maintenance Rule generally followed the guidance in NUMARC 93-01, "Industry Guideline for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants," dated May 1993, which was endorsed in Regulatory Guide 1.160, "Monitoring the Effectiveness of Nuclear Power Plants," dated January 1995. However, the team identified two weaknesses with your Maintenance Rule Program implementation. The first involved insufficient training and guidance for your staff, and resulted in a failure to effectively identify maintenance preventable functional failures. The second involved the procedures by which you implemented 10 CFR 50.65(a)(3), and resulted in a lack of detailed guidance for: (1) the assessment of the safety impact of removing structures, systems, or components from service for monitoring and preventive maintenance; (2) the balancing of reliability and availability; and, (3) the performance of periodic maintenance effectiveness evaluations. We believe these weaknesses justify a continued emphasis by your staff to ensure effective monitoring of equipment performance, adequate guidance for risk evaluations, and proper training for site personnel. 9702030185 970129 PDR ADOCK 05000397 Q PDR Washington Public Power Supply System -2-In addition to the weaknesses above-noted, the team identified two violations of NRC requirements. The first violation concerned your failure to monitor the unavailability of three risk-significant systems, while the second related to your failure to develop appropriate performance criteria for monitoring the reliability of risk-significant structures, system, and components. Our concern that resulted from these violations was that the conditions we identified could have resulted in a failure to recognize degrading performance of structures, systems, or components that are important to safety. These violations are cited in the enclosed Notice of Violation (Notice) and the circumstances surrounding the violations are described in detail in the enclosed report. Since Mr. Bemis' letter of January 2, 1997, addressed the violations and provided the corrective actions you plan to address the root causes, you are not required to respond to this letter. However, you are required to submit a written statement or explanation pursuant to 10 CFR 2.201 if the description therein does not accurately reflect your corrective actions or your position. In that case, or if you choose to respond, pleas~ follow the inspections in the enclosed Notice when preparing your reply. We will perform a followup inspection in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of the corrective action. In accordance with 10 CFR 2.790 of the NRC's "Rules of Practice," a copy of this letter, its enclosures, and your response will be placed in the NRC Public Document Room (PDR). To the extent possible, your response should not include any personal privacy, proprietary, or safeguards information so that it can be placed in the PDR without redaction. Should you have any questions concerning this inspection, we will be pleased to discuss them with you. Sincerely, Docket No.: 50-397 license No.: NPF-21 \....../ Enclosures: 1. Notice of Violation 2. 	NRC Inspection Report 50-397/96-18 cc w/enclosures: Frederick S.
