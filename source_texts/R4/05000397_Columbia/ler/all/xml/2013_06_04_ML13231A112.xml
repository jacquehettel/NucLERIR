   <P>When perfonnlng a logic system functional test (LSFT) of the Remote Shutdown Panel transfer
      switch [JS) during refueling outage R21 on June 4,2013, the procedure for testing the remote
      transfer switch for the suppression pool spray valve [ISV] failed because a jumper [57] had
      been left Installed following a new bucket (breaker) installation at the Motor Control Center
      [MCC) during the previous refueling outage R20. Asatisfactory LSFT was perfonned prior to the
      installation of the new bucket into the MeC but this LSFT was not re-perfonned to verify the
      operability of the new bucket after installation. The problem went undetected until the R21
      LSFT test failed. The remote transfer switch W8slnoperable from May 16, 2011 until June 4,
      2013 when the condition was discovered. This resulted In failure to meet Surveillance
      Requirement (SR) 3.3.3.2.4 and non-compliance with Technical Specifications (TS) Umlting
      Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.2. The preli~inary apparent causes have been Identified
      a8: (1) a lack of a standard for Work Order instructions involving the removal and
      installation of jumpers. resulting In personnel having to rely on experience and skill of the
      craft for the proper way of executing and doCumenting required modifications; and (2)
      inadequate deciSion making resulting In the use of a post maintenance testing procedure after
      the installation of the Spectrum bucket In May 2011 that dJd not adequately prove operability. </P>

      <P>The event was discovered June 4,2013 when a logic system functionaJ test (LSFT) ~the
         Suppression Poof Remote Transfer Switch [JS) failed. The plant was in Mode 5 during
         refuefing outage R21 With the reactor mode switch in Refuef. </P>

   <eventDesc>
      <P>On 610412013, during performance of surveillance procedure on the control power transfer
         switch [JS] lOcated in the Remote Shutdown Panel, a step to verify no continuity (contacts
         open) for the transfer switch for the suppression pool spray valve RHR-V-27B (ISV] failed.
         Failure of the surveillance was attributed to a jumper [S7] installed (88-found) in 480V
         Motor Control Center [MCC) starter controls contained In the new bucket. The jumper had
         been left in place since refueling outage R20 when the Spectrum bucket (breaker) was
         installed on May 16, 2011 . The transfer switch was, therefore, inoperable since the jumper
         was left in ptace, because SUrveillance Requirement 3.3.3.2.4 under Technical
         Specifications (TS) Umlting Condition for Operation (LeO) 3.3.3.2. The Remote Shutdown
         System Functions Shan Be Operable, would not have been met when In Modes 1 or 2. </P>

   <correctiveAction type="immediate">
      <P>The jumper was removed and the loosened terminals were torqued to restore bucket to design
         configuration. </P>
   </correctiveAction>
   <eventCause>
      <P>The Cause Evaluation identified preliminary apparent causes of this event as follows: (1) a
         tack of a standard for Work Order instructions Involving removal and installation of
         jumpers, which requires personnel to rely on experience and skill of the craft for the
         proper way of executing and documenting required modifications; and (2) Inadequate decision
         making resulting In the use of a post maintenance testing procedure after the Instanation
         of the Spectrum bucket In May 2011 that did not adequately prove operability. </P>
   </eventCause>
   <correctiveAction type="further">
      <P>Procedures will be revised to provide addftlonallevef of detail for work order steps
         InvoMng determination and termination of wires, cables and jumpers. </P>

      <P>Additional corrective actions are being Investigated that may result In additiOnal proposed
         corrective measures. A supplement to this Licensee Event Report will be submitted If the
         final corrective action ptan Is substantively different than that Included In this form. </P>

      <P>The remote transfer switch is located at the Remote Shutdown Panel. The switch transfers
         control of the Division 2 suppress/on pool spray valve from the Main Control Room to the
         Remote Shutdown Panel and vice versa. The suppression pool spray valve Is used to provide
         cooling to the wetwell portion of the primary containment as a means to control containment
         pressure during an accident. </P>

      <P>The jumpered terminals In the remote shutdown transfer switch did not Impact the operation
         of the suppression pool spray valve from the Main Control Room. </P>

      <P>With the jumper left in place the operation of the suppression pool spray valve could be
         Impacted from the Remote Shutdown Panel because of loss of starter control power for valve
         RHR·V·27B under some abnormal scenarios (I.e., fire in the Main Control Room), which would
         require the r~plaC8ment of a blown fuse prior to being able to operate the valve from the
         Remote Shutdown Panel. However the normal osition for this valve Is closed and it would not
         normallu be operated from the Remote
         Shutdown Panel in the event of a fire In the Control Room. Therefore the safety
         significance of this failure is low.</P>
   </safetyConsequences>
   <previousEvents>There are several documented conditions
         with simitar drcumstances invoMng improper removal or installation of jumpers. However,
         they were due to Improper placement or removal of jumpers and did not invotve jumpers being
         left In for an extended period of time.</previousEvents>
