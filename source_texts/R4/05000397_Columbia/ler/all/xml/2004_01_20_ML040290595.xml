I.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) (16) At 1247 on May 21,2001, Columbia Generating Station was in Mode 3 when the HPCS pump (HPCS-P-l) and the HPCS System were declared inoperable due to low pressure in the HPCS water leg pump discharge piping. Operations was in the process of transferring water from the condensate.storageJankS..1o_the .suppressioI}.pool_whepJhe_suctiOItPJl!!.1..10 .HPCS-~-l was isolated._ HPCS-P-l was immediately secured. HPCS System discharge pressure subsequently dropped to the low-pressure alarm setpoint, requiring Operations to declare HPCS-P-1 inoperable. After filling and venting the HPCS System, HPCS-P-1 and the HPCS System were declared operable at 1322 on May 21, 2001. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 (a) (2) (v) (D) because HPCS is a single train safety system that was unable to perform its required safety function for approximately 35 minutes. The plant remained in compliance with technical specifiCations, and was in a condition where both low pressure coolant injection and low pressure core spray were capable of providing flow to the reactor pressure vessel. Although this event occurred over two years ago, Energy Northwest did not discover that the event should have been reported as a single train safety system failure until November 20,2003. </Figure><P>26158 Rl </P><P>,', </P><P>-</P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBERJ6) </TD><TD>PAGE (3) 20F3</TD></TR><TR><TH>Columbia Generating Station </TH><TD>05000397 </TD><TD>YEAR I SEQUENTIAL IREVISION NUMBER NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TD>2001-003-00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) Event Description On May 21,2001, with the plant in Mode 3, the High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) System [BG] was being used to transfer water from the condensate storage tanks (CSTs) [KA] to the suppression pool as part of planned outage water management activities. An expected HPCS pump suction switchover from the CSTs to the suppression pool occurred due to high suppression pool level. When HPCS-V-15 (HPCS pump suction from the suppression pool) -~-r-ea-&quot;&quot;chea'its full open p'osiiiOii:-~m operator attempted to override theswiichover by taking the HPCS-V-15 control switch to close. HPCS-V-l (HPCS pump suction from the CST) was closing when the operator then attempted to open HPCS-V-l by taking the HPCS-V-l control switch to open. HPCS-V-15 fully closed, as expected. However, HPCS-V-l continued to travel from the intermediate to the closed position, isolating the HPCS-P-l suction path. HPCS-P-l was immediately secured by the operator. With the suppression pool test return valve (HPCS-V-23) throttled open for the water transfer, HPCS system discharge pressure dropped rapidly to the low-pressure alarm setpoint, at which time HPCS-P-l and the HPCS System were declared inoperable. HPCS-P-l control power fuses were also removed. Immediate Corrective Action HPCS-V-I was opened to reestablish a suction flow path for HPCS-P-l. The HPCS System was filled and vented, and the system was declared operable approximately 35 minutes after declaring HPCS-P-l inoperable. Cause of Event The primary cause of this event was inadequate procedural guidance for overriding the _b--expected&quot;HPCS -pump-suction&quot;'Switchoverfrom ·the 'CSTs&quot;to ·the-suppression 'pool:-Plant --,.-.~procedures did not warn the operators' of the pote.ntial loss of the HPCS pump suction'path if the operators did not first verify the suction switchover was complete (HPCS-V-15 open and HPCS-V-l closed), prior to closing HPCS-V-15, and opening HPCS-V-l. A contributing cause to this event was that the pre-job brief performed by the operators was not thorough in that it did not recognize the suction switchover logic. Additional Corrective Action A HPCS operating procedure was modified to ensure that the suppression pool high-level HPCS suction switchover is complete, prior to overriding the switchover by re-positioning HPCS-V-15 and HPCS-V-l. </TH></TR></Table><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) u.s.

The plant remained in compliance with technical specifications, and was in a condition where both low-pressure coolant injection [BO] and low-pressure core spray [BM] were capable of providing flow to the reactor pressure vessel during the 35 minutes the HPCS System was inoperable. Similar Events __--:.;;.;;;;.;;.;=;.....;;:;~=--_ ... -------------------'''---~---::::--~~---I On October 7, 2003, with the plant in Mode 1, a depressurization of the HPCS System occurred while the HPCS System water leg piping was isolated during an unscheduled maintenance activity to replace the power frame on the water leg pump. System pressure unexpectedly decreased to below the low-pressure alarm point requiring plant operators to declare the HPCS System inoperable. After performing a system fill and vent procedure, the HPCS System was declared operable. This event is documented in LER 2003-010-00. </TH></TR><TR><TH>-----______&quot;.__.c_-______ -'--'._&quot; -------~.&quot;-.----. --</TH></TR></Table><P>26158 Rl </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
