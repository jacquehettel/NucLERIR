A satisfactory LSFT was perfonned prior to the Installation of the new bucket into the MCC but this LSFT was not re-performed to verify the operability of the new bucket after installation. The problem went undetected until the R21 LSFT test failed. The remote transfer switch was inoperable from May 16, 2011 . until June 4, 2013 when the condltlon was discovered.

The plant was in Mode 5 during refueling outage R21 with the reactor mode switch In Refuel. </P><P>EVENT DESCRIPTION </P><P>On 610412013, during performance of surveillance procedure on the control power transfer switch (JS] located in the Remote Shutdown Panel, a step to verify no continuity (contacts open) for the transfer switch for the suppression pool spray valve RHR-V-27B [ISV] failed. Failure of the surveillance was attributed to a jumper [57} Installed (as-found) in 480V Motor Control Center (MCC) starter controls contained In the new bucket. The jumper had been left in place since refueling outage R20 when the Spectrum bucket (breaker) was installed on May 16, 2011. The transfer switch was, therefore. Inoperable since the jumper was left in place, because Surveillance Requirement 3.3.3.2.4 under Technical Specifications (TS) Umltlng Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.2. The Remota Shutdown System Functions Shall Be Operable. would not have been met when in Modes 1 or 2. </P><P>iMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION </P><P>The jumper was removed and the loosened terminals were torqued to restore bucket to design configuration. </P><P>CAUSE </P><P>The Cause Evaluation Identified preliminary apparent causes of this event as follows: (1) a lack of a standard for Work Order Instructions Involving removal and installation of Jumpers. which requires personnel to rely on experience and .sklll of the craft for the proper way of executing and documenting required modifications; and (2) Inadequate decision making 'resulting in the use of a post maintenance testing procedure after the Installation of the Spectrum bucket In May 2011 that did not adequately prove operability. </P><P>.FURTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION </P><P>,Procedures will be revised to provide additional level of detail for work order steps Involving determination and termination 'of wires. cables and Jumpers. . </P><P>'Additional corrective actions are being investigated that may result In additional proposed corrective measures. A supplement to this Licensee Event Report will be submitted If the final corrective action plan is substantively different than ·that Included In this form. </P><P>ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES </P><P>The remote transfer switch Is located at the Remote Shutdown Panel. The switch transfers control of the Division 2 
suppression pool spray valve from the Main Control Room to the Remote Shutdown Panel and vice versa. The 
suppression pool spray valve Is used to provide cooling to the wetwelf portion of the primary containment as a means to 
</P><P>.control containment pressure during an accident. </P><P>The jumpered terminals in the remote shutdown transfer switch did not impact the operation of the suppression pool spray valve from the Main Control Room. </P><P>With the jumper left in place the operation of the suppression pool spray valve eould be impacted from the Remote ,Shutdown Panel because of loss of starter control power for valve RHA·V·278 under some abnormal scenarios (Le.• fire in the M~ln C~mtrol Room). which would require the replacement of a blown fuslS prIor to able to operate the valve </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2013_10_04_ML13290A152_img_3.jpg"/>Remote </Figure><P>26158 R5 NRC FORM 366A U.s.

</P><Sect><H1>~------------------~--------------------~ 
</H1><P>SIMILAR EVENTS </P><P>There are several documented conditions with similar circumstances Involving Improper removal or Installation of jumpers. However. they were due to Improper placement or removal of Jumpers and did not Involve jumpers being laft in for an extended period of time. </P><P>ENERGY INDUSTRY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (ells) INFORMATION CODeS </P><P>EllS codes are bracketed [} where applicable in the narrative. </P><P>* * * * * SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT * * * * * </P><P>Ucensee Event Report (LER) 2013-004-00 was originally submitted pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(1)(8) and 50.73(a)(2)(v)(O). This supplement withdraws selection of the latter reportabllity criterion. 5O.73(a)(2)(v)(D) because It Is not applicable to this event. On completion of the evaluation and further review of the engineering assessment It has been determined that the jumper that was left In place In the breaker of the RHR-V-27B valve would not have prevented fulfillment of a safety function that 1&amp; needed to shut down the reactor and maintain It in a safe shutdown condition. or to mitigate the consequences of an accident. </P><P>Review of the Engineering assessment of this event indicates that the presence of the Jumper In the breaker for the RHR
V-27B valve would not have Impacted the ability to operate the valve from the Control Room. Therefore operation of 
RHR-V-27B for heat dissipation In the suppression pool In the event of an accident (I.e•• LOCA) would not have been 
prevented by the jumper. Thus the operation of the RHR·V·278 valve needed to mitigate the consequences of an 
accident was not Impacted. 
</P><P>An assessment of the ability to safely shutdown the reactor and maintain It in a shutdown condition and the ability to remove residual heat from the core was completed and determined that there was no Impact on either of these functions. This Is based on the fact that although the Installation of the jumper could have caused a loss of control power to the valve when It is transferred to the Remote Shutdown Panel, the IOS8 of power to RHRN·278 would not Impact Its safety function because the valve Is normally closed and would fall as Is. Additionally the Post Fire Safe Shutdown (PFSS) Analysis establishes as a basis that all plant safe shutdown equipment Is functional and that there are no tests or maintenance activities going on at the time of fire Ignition. Thus it is assumed that the RHR-V-278 valve would be closed for afire that required Main Control Room evacuation and would fall In that pOSition If the transfer to the remote shutdown panel would have caused the fuses to blow. Therefore, the ability to make up coolant to the reactor using Division 2 AHR or to go Into shutdown cooling Is not Impacted. </P><P>26158 AS </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
