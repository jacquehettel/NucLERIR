NARRATIVE (If more space is required. use additional copies ofNRC Form 366A) DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 0549 on August 9, 2004, with Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) in mode 4, an Energy Northwest security X-ray machine operator detected a loaded handgun in the backpack of an Energy Northwest employee at Columbia's Protected Area (PA) access control point (ref: Event Report 40933). Security personnel immediately controlled the handgun and the individual was segregated and searched. The individual's access to the PA was suspended and he left the owner controlled area following a fitness for duty test. Local law enforcement (Benton County Sheriff) responded and took possession of the firearm. This event meets the criteria specified in 10 CFR § 73, Appendix G, paragraph I(d), as this was an attempted introduction of contraband into Columbia's PA. This report is made pursuant to the requirement of 10 CFR § 73 Appendix G(I) for a 60-day follow-up written report. Regulatory Guide 5.62, revision 1, section 3.2, instructs licensees to use NRC Form 366 when submitting these reports and describes the report content that is sufficient for NRC analysis and evaluation. Because this event does not involve a security system failure or a threat related incident, only items 1 through 14 in section 3.2 of the Regulatory Guide are germane to this issue and are addressed below: Date and Time of Event August 9, 2004 at 0549 PDT. Location of Actual or Threatened Event The event occurred in the search area of Columbia's Protected Area (PA) access control checkpoint. Plant Operating Phase At the time of this event, Columbia was in mode 4. Safety Systems Threatened, directly or indirectly Because the event did not result in an actual introduction of contraband into the protected area, no safety systems were threatened. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSI LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Number and type of personnel involved Three Energy Northwest Nuclear Security Officers (NSOs) were involved. One NSO with the handgun in his backpack and two on-duty NSOs performing searches with the X-ray machine. Method of discovery of incident The contraband was detected as the NSO's backpack was processed through the X-ray machine in the protected area access control point. Procedural errors involved Although this action was a violation of an Energy Northwest policy, there were no procedural errors involved. Immediate actions taken in response to event Upon discovery of the contraband, security officers took control of the handgun while the employee was segregated and searched. A local law enforcement official was summoned to the scene and took possession of the firearm. The individual's access to the PA was suspended and he left the owner controlled area after a determination of fitness for duty was made. Corrective actions taken or planned The NSO with the handgun in his backpack received disciplinary action and security department personnel were briefed on the event. The NSO's unescorted access to the PA was reinstated following satisfactory completion of fitness for duty testing and psychological evaluation. Local. State. or Federal law enforcement agencies contacted The local law enforcement agency (Benton County Sheriff) was contacted and took possession of the firearm. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) u.s.
