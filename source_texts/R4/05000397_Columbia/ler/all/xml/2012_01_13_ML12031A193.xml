   <abstract>On February 28, 2010, following investigations of a small amount of oil found in the
      vicinity of the division 3 emergency diesel generator (OG-3) electro-hydraulic type governor
      (governor), OG-3 was being operated to validate no oil leakage from the governor. OG-3 started
      experiencing load oscillations of approximately 300 kW after 45 minutes of full load
      operation. Subsequent investigative actions revealed the load instabilities were present in
      all modes of operation (idle, rated speed, and fully loaded) which indicated a governor
      control problem. Following troubleshooting, the OG-3 governor was replaced. OG-3 testing was
      completed and was returned to service on March 4, 2010. The direct cause of the event is
      believed to be related to foreign material left in the governor as early as 2005 and that the
      root cause of the event was organizational decision making did not adequately consider long
      term risks and consequences associated with operating the governor with known foreign material
      intrusion. However, additional factors such as wear due to aging, flushing the governor with
      fuel oil, and overfilling the governor could not be ruled out as contributors to the cause.
      The Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) is under revision to consider other forensic analysis and a
      supplemental LER is planned.</abstract>

      <plantConds>Columbia Generating Station (CGS) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power. There
         were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of this event
         and that contributed to this event.</plantConds>
      <eventDesc>On February 28, 2010, following investigations of a small amount of oil found in
         the vicinity of the division 3 emergency diesel generator (OG-3) [DG] electro-hydraulic
         type governor (governor) [65], OG-3 was being operated to validate no oilleaka:ge from the
         governor. OG-3 started experiencing load oscillations of approximately 300 kW after 45
         minutes of full load operation. Subsequent investigative actions revealed the load
         instabilities were present in all modes of operation (idle, rated speed, and fully loaded)
         which indicated a governor control problem. Following troubleshooting, the governor was
         replaced. DG-3 completed testing and was returned to service on March 4, 2010. The forensic
         investigation of the removed governor revealed a large amount of foreign material
         throughout. Prior to disassembly, the oil was drained from the governor and evidence of oil
         product breakdown and fuel oil contamination was found. There were small pieces of terminal
         strip material (blue in color) that fell into the governor in 2005 found throughout the
         governor. Although the blue material was identified as a major contributor to the load
         oscillations by the forensic investigation vendor, other factors such as wear from aging,
         flushing the governor with fuel oil, and overfilling the governor could also have
         contributed to the failure. On October 14, 2005, during the repair of a failed shutdown
         solenoid [SOL], a vendor broke a terminal strip which resulted in a broken piece
         approximately 1/8&quot; by 3/16&quot; falling into the governor. The governor was flushed
         with fuel oil in an effort to retrieve the piece of broken strip, however, the piece was
         not found nor recovered. DG-3 was returned to service on October 15, 2005 following
         satisfactory completion of the monthly surveillance. The justification for continued
         operation with the foreign material assumed that the softness and the physical size of the
         material would not adversely impact the ability of the governor to maintain DG-3 engine
         speed at a specified value. In addition, the foreign material was heavier than the oil and
         was assumed to sink to the bottom of the oil reservoir. No load oscillations were observed
         in DG-3 during subsequent surveillance runs prior to the February 28, 2010 event. Total run
         time on DG-3 from the last biennial 24 hour surveillance run on May 21,2008 until the load
         oscillation event on February 28, 2010 was approximately 78 hours. An evaluation was
         initiated to assess DG-3 operability status from May 21,2008 to February 28,2010. Based on
         the results of the evaluation, assuming the presence of the foreign material was the direct
         cause, from September 10, 2009 through February 28, 2010, it is postulated that DG-3 may
         not have been able to fulfill a 24 hour mission time and thus, is considered inoperable
         during that time. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.8.1, Condition B requires an inoperable
         DG to be restored to operable status within 14 days, otherwise Condition F requires the
         unit to be in Mode 3 within 12 hours and Mode 4 within 36 hours. Consequently, the
         condition of CGS not in compliance with Condition F is a condition prohibited by TS and
         reportable to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8). </eventDesc>
      <correctiveActions>OG-3 was declared inoperable on February 28, 2010, the governor was
         replaced on March 2, 2010, surveillance testing was completed, and DG-3 was declared
         operable on March 4, 2010.</correctiveActions>
      <eventCause>The direct cause of the event is believed to be related to foreign material left
         in the governor as early as 2005 and that the root cause of the event was organizational
         decision making did not adequately consider long term risks and consequences associated
         with operating the governor with known foreign material intrusion. However, additional
         factors such as wear due to aging, flushing the governor with fuel oil, and overfilling the
         governor could not be ruled out as contributors to the cause. The RCE is under revision to
         consider other forensic analysis and a supplemental LER is planned.</eventCause>
      <correctiveActions>Further corrective actions included strengthening foreign material
         intrusion actions in operability determinations and maintenance procedures and providing
         training on lessons learned to the management committee responsible for station health
         issues. The RCE is under revision and additional corrective actions are being taken to
         address failure to report within 60 days in accordance with 10 CFR
         50.73.</correctiveActions>
      <safetyConsequences>There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this condition.
         Critical electrical bus SM-4 [8U] is normally energized from Normal Auxiliary transformer
         TR-N1 [XFMR] thru non-critical bus SM-2 when the main generator [GEN] is operating and from
         Startup Auxiliary transformer TR-S thru SM-2 when the main generator is not operating. DG-3
         provides emergency power to SM-4. SM-4 was available and powered by either TR-N1 or TR-S
         throughout the time frame DG-3 was postulated to be inoperable.</safetyConsequences>
      <previousEvents>A search of CGS Licensee Event Reports and the Corrective Action Program for
         the last 10 years found no other instances where load oscillations were observed on an
         emergency diesel generator due to a failed governor.</previousEvents>
