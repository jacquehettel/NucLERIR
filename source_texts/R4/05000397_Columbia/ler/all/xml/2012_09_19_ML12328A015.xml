   <abstract>On September 19, 2012, Energy Northwest (EN) identified that both divisions of Residual
      Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Cooling (SDC) Reactor Vessel isolation valves were inappropriately
      made inoperable at the same time on multiple occasions in support of maintenance and
      surveillance testing during the 2011 refueling outage (R-20). This planned inoperability of
      the SDC isolation valves was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS
      contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SDC isolation valves and
      the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both
      divisions SDC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of SDC
      isolation valves were made inoperable without procedural guidance, this is being reported as a
      condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are
      needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident. An evaluation
      in accordance with the corrective action program is currently in progress. A supplemental
      report will be submitted to add additional details concerning the evaluation's conclusions and
      corrective actions.</abstract>

      <eventDesc>On September 19, 2012, Energy Northwest (EN) identified that both divisions of
         Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Cooling (SOC) Reactor Vessel isolation valves were
         inappropriately made inoperable at the same time on multiple occasions in support of
         maintenance and surveillance testing during the 2011 refueling outage (R-20). This issue
         was identified and entered into the Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) corrective
         action program following review of the NRC Operating Experience Smart Sample (OpESS)
         2012/02, Revision 1. All required technical specification conditions for inoperable primary
         containment isolation valves were entered when the valves were made inoperable, and
         compliance with actions was maintained. No operations with a potential to drain the reactor
         vessel were in progress. Columbia was in Mode 5 with the vessel flooded up. Ouring R-20, EN
         implemented a plant modification to change the Group 1 isolation valves reactor water level
         signal from level 2 to level 1. The NRC granted permission for this change to technical
         specifications (TS) in a letter dated August 18, 2009 (TAC NO. M09598). This planned
         inoperability of the SOC isolation valves, in support of the maintenance and surveillance
         activities associated with the modification to change the isolation Signal from level 2 to
         level 1, was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SOC-BYPASS. SOP-RHRSOC-BYPASS contains the
         specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SOC isolation valves and the
         subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SOC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both
         divisions of SOC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions
         of the SOC isolation valves were made inoperable and the approved procedure did not provide
         specific guidance for removal of both divisions at the same time, this is being reported as
         a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems
         that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
         This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and
         50.73(a)(2)(v)(O).</eventDesc>
      <extentConds>An extent of condition review was performed. The only instances of both divisions
         of RHR SOC isolation valves being inoperable at the same time was during R-20. There were
         multiple instances in which this occurred in R-20.</extentConds>
      <correctiveAction>No immediate corrective action was required.</correctiveAction>
      <eventCause>The correction action process to determine a cause is still in progress. This
         information will be provided in the supplemental report.</eventCause>
      <previousEvents>This had not previously occurred at Columbia.</previousEvents>
      <correctiveActions>The correction action process to determine corrective actions is still in
         progrÂ·ess. This information will be provided in the supplemental
         report.</correctiveActions>
      <safetyConsequences>Each occurrence took place when the plant was in Mode 5 with the reactor
         vessel in a flooded condition. No operations with a potential to drain the vessel were in
         progress. The inoperability of the RHR SDC isolation valves was not due to equipment
         failure. If a loss of reactor level was detected, the isolation valves could be quickly
         restored to an operable condition. All required TS conditions were entered. Compliance with
         all TS actions was maintained. There was no significant impact on safety
         consequences.</safetyConsequences>
