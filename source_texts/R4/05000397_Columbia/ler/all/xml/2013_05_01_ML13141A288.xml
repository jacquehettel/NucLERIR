   <abstract>In October 2012, It was determined that the Technical Specification (TS) surveillance
      procedure to verify that each control room air conditioning (AC) subsystem has the capability
      to remove the assumed heat load for TS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.4.1 did not satisfy
      the surveiRance requirement. The methodology for the existing surveillance had been in use
      since 1998 around the time Energy Northwest converted to the Improved Technical
      Specifications. T8 SR 3.0.3 was Invoked and a new surveillance procedure was developed. On
      March 2, 2013, while perfonning the new surveillance procedure, the test results revealed that
      the air handler thermal performance for the MAn train did not meet the acceptance criteria.
      this failure to satisfy SR 3.7.4.1 in March. following entry Into SR 3.0.3, is reportable
      under 10 CFR 5O.73(a)(2)(i)(9) -Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's
      technical specifications. <P>The control room AC subsystem has been cleaned, retested, and
         returned to operable status. </P></abstract>

      <eventDesc>In October 2012, it was determined that the Technical Specification (TS)

         has the capabHtty to remove the assumed heat load for TS Surveillance Requirement (SR)
         3.7.4.1 did not satisfy the surveillance requirement. The methodology for the existing
         survelllance had been in use since 1998 around the time Energy Northwest converted to the
         Improved Technical Specifications. T8 SR 3.0.3 was Invoked. An informational test was
         perfonned on November 3,2012, indicating acceptable pelformance of the cooter lelR). A new
         surveillance procedure was developed and on March 2, 2013. whOe performing the new
         surveiHance, the test results revealed that the air handler thermal perfonnance for the
         &quot;Aft train did not meet the acceptance criteria. This faUure to satisfy'SR 3.7.4.1 in
         March, following entry into SR 3.0.3, is reportable under 10 eFA 5O.73(a)(2)(I)(8) -Any

      <eventCause>The direct cause was determined to be macro-fouling of the water side of the
         tubes. The presence of large anode deposits, due to degradation of the zinc sacrificial
         anode. and sediment In the tower tubes of the cooling coils were blocking flow. The
         apparent cause was tack of a periodic performance test. With no component specific periodic
         performance test specified timely identtflcation of degradation. and subsequent action to
         mitigate the degradation. was not possible to prevent component faUure. No routine
         surveiHance on this cooler had been performed for '16 years. . , Contributing to this
         failure was a lack of procedural guidance to balance flow through the cooling coils. The
         control room coolers are unique in that they are the only doubte coli coolers used for
         service water systems [Bll. There Is no flow indication for the individual COils. only the
         total flow. Thermal performance testing found that flow was not properly balanced between
         the coils. Another contributing cause was a general Increase in the sediment levels of the
         service water system.</eventCause>

         <P>The main Control room has two divisions of air handling units, each with the capability
            to maintain temperatures within the required limits during accident conditions. The main
            control room air coolers are required to have a minimum efficiency of 65% to provide the
            required cooling for a design basis event. In November 2012, the measured effic4ency of
            the &quot;A&quot; train AC was 67% as obtained by a maintenance test. The measured
            efficiency for the &quot;A&quot; train AC in March 2013 was 62.6%. The &quot;8&quot;
            train AC efficiency was greater than 65%. The &quot;B&quot; train AC was fully capable
            of maintaining required control room temperatures. The &quot;A&quot; train AC was still
            capable of providing adequate cootlng for most situations. Since November 2012 the
            &quot;S&quot; train was not been available for service on three occasions each with an
            outage duration of less than 1 day. During these times the MA&quot; train would still
            have been capable of maintaining the control room within the required limits due to
            actual conditions being signlficantty less than design basis conditions (ambient
            temperature of 105°F and service water temperature of noF). </P>

         <P>In addition to the coolers utiliZing service water, the main control room AC subsystem
            also has the capability to be aligned to emergency chillers (KMJ, which provide
            additional cooling capability. Each diviSion of the main control room air handier has
            two sets of coolers. One emergency cooler and one for normal HVAC. Both emergency
            coolers can be lined up to either servtce water or an emergency chiller, a clean
            ctosed-toop system. Typically, the flA&quot; train Is &quot;ned up to service water and
            the fiB&quot; train to an emergency chiller. </P>

         <P>The safety significance of one main control room cooler having a slightly reduced
            efficiency was minimal. </P>
