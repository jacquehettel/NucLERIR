EVENT DESCRIPTION On December 30, 2012, at 0530 PST both doors [EllS: DR] of the 471 elevation airlock [EllS: AL] entrance of the Reactor Building [EllS: NG] were simultaneously opened for a short period of time. This was the result of the failure of the interlock [EllS: IMEC] between the outer security door R-204, and the inner door R-205. The interlock's mechanical bolt on the outer security door failed to engage allowing the outer security door to be opened when the inner door was already open. A security officer and an equipment operator were involved. They immediately realized the problem, quickly shut the doors, and contacted the main control room. Both doors were simultaneously open for only a few seconds. Having a condition where both doors in a Reactor Building airlock were opened simultaneously while not undergoing a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing, results in an unintended entry into Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1 Secondary Containment due to a failure to satisfy Surveillance Requirement SR 3.6.4.1.3. SR 3.6.4.1.3 requires verification that each secondary containment access inner door or each secondary containment access outer door in each access opening is closed. It was determined that this condition resulted in a loss of safety function (Secondary Containment) and was reported to the NRC (Event Notification 48639) at 1245 PST on December 30, 2012. The reactor building is maintained at a negative pressure to minimize potential leakage of radioactivity to the environment. During normal operations, the reactor building ventilation system maintains this negative pressure. During a design basis accident, the Standby Gas Treatment System [EllS: BH] maintains this negative pressure. This brief opening of the doors had no measurable impact on the reactor building pressure indication. IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION Access through the airlock was restricted by locking the outer security door (R-204) until repairs could be made. The interlock mechanism was repaired the following day. CAUSE A root cause evaluation of the issue determined that there were two root causes. First Root Cause (RC1 ): A legacy design weakness for the Secondary Containment airlock door interlocks allows conditions where both the inner and outer doors can be opened at the same time. Second Root Cause (RC2): Implementation of TSTF-18-A, Rev 1, at Columbia (November 1998) changed the wording of TS SR Bases 3.6.4.1.2 and SR 3.6.4.1.3, reducing the clarity of the description of conditions that define Secondary Containment operability. FURTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION 1. Evaluate potential alternatives, then process and implement a design change which results in a more reliable door lockin device, im rove the interlock 10 ic to eliminate current desi n im erfections, and </TH></TR></Table><P>26158 R5 </P></Sect><Sect><H1>I, l

Revise Technical Specification bases for SR 3.6.4.1.2 and SR 3.6.4.1.3 to ensure that the wording clearly identifies that Secondary Containment operability requires that one door in each airlock be closed at all times when Secondary Containment is required. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES There was no equipment damage, injuries or dose exposure to station personnel. There was no change in plant status or operating condition and there was no actual risk to the public at any time. There was no impact to public health and safety as the Primary Containment was intact, and Secondary Containment ventilation system maintained the designed negative pressure inside the Reactor Building during the event. There was a potential significance if there had been an event where the Primary Containment was breached concurrent with a loss of coolant accident or a fuel handing accident such that radioactive materials were released to the Reactor Building. Having both Reactor Building airlock doors open would potentially provide a release path for radioactive materials to enter the external environment. SIMILAR EVENTS A review of various databases at Columbia found a total of 40 similar events dating back to 1995. Not all of these events resulted in a loss of Secondary Containment. Some of these events occurred during a Mode in which Secondary Containment was not required to be operable. Some were an interlock failure only and both doors were not opened simultaneously. A review of the NRC Event Notification database found the following similar events: • Event Notification 45975, 6/3/10 at Monticello • Event Notification 46155, 8/5/10 at Monticello • Event Notification 46394, 11/4/10 at Monticello • Event Notification 48282, 9/6/12 at Quad Cities • Event Notification 48295, 9/10/12 at Cooper ENERGY INDUSTRY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (EllS) INFORMATION CODES EllS codes are bracketed [] where applicable in the narrative. </TH></TR></Table><P>26158 R5 </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
