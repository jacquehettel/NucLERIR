   <abstract>On August 22,2012, it was discovered that during maintenance on breaker E-CB-S/1,
      required Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 Condition A was not entered. The breaker provides
      power to an essential bus from one of the credited offsite power sources. While E-CB-S/1 was
      out of service, Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) would not have been able to meet
      acceptance criteria in a surveillance procedure used to satisfy Surveillance Requirement (SR)
      3.8.1.1. Therefore, per SR 3.0.1 , failure to meet the surveillance requirement indicates that
      Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 was not met. The breaker was inoperable for
      approximately 30 hours, resulting in the failure to meet the Required Actions described in
      Condition A and F within the specified Completion Times. The apparent cause was determined to
      be conflicting information between the associated TS Bases and the surveillance procedure. The
      contributing cause was determined to be inadequate process for operability determinations when
      equipment is removed from service for maintenance activities or due to equipment
      failure.</abstract>

   <narrative>

      <plantConds>Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power.
         There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of this
         event and that contributed to this event.</plantConds>
      <eventDesc>On August 22, 2012, it was discovered that during maintenance on breaker E-CB-S/1
         [BKR], required Technical Specification (TS) Action Statement (TSAS) 3.8.1 Condition A was
         not entered. The breaker provides power to the Division 1 critical electrical bus E-SM-7
         [BU] from the credited offsite source, E-TR-S [XFMR]. It was discovered that while E-CB-S/1
         was out of service, Columbia would not have been able to satisfy acceptance criteria in the
         associated surveillance procedure used to satisfy Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.1.
         Therefore, per SR 3.0.1, failure to meet the surveillance requirement indicates that
         Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 was not met. The breaker was inoperable for
         approximately 30 hours, resulting in the failure to meet the Required Actions described in
         TS 3.8.1 Condition A and F, within the specified Completion Times.</eventDesc>
      <correctiveActions type="immediate">Night orders were initiated notifying operations personnel
         of the issue and the appropriate measures to take going forward when planning work with the
         associated breakers. Specifically, any work which impacts the ability of E-TR-S to supply
         power to the critical electrical bus for Division 1 or Division 2 will require entry into
         TS 3.8.1 Condition A.</correctiveActions>
      <eventCauses>The apparent cause was determined to be conflicting information between TS Bases
         3.8.1 and the surveillance procedure. The contributing cause was determined to be an
         inadequate process for operability determinations when equipment is removed from service
         for maintenance activities or due to equipment failure. </eventCauses>
      <correctiveActions type="further">The following corrective actions are planned or have been
         completed: • Develop methodology to be used by operations when making operability
         determinations for equipment removed from service. • Enhance procedures concerning
         operability determinations for equipment removed from service. • Initiate training requests
         to train operators on methodology to be used when making operability determinations for
         equipment removed from service. • Revise associated operations procedures based on TS Bases
         requirements. • Develop a formal position for offsite power requirements. • Conduct a
         focused self-assessment to ensure the adequacy of TS Bases and implementation of TS
         SRs.</correctiveActions>
      <safetyConsequences>There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this condition.
         Critical electrical buses E-SM-7 and E-SM-8 [BU] are normally energized from Normal
         Auxiliary transformer, E-TR-N1 [XFMR], when the main generator [GEN] is
         operating.</safetyConsequences>
      <previousEvents>A search was performed for each time E-CB-S/1 was taken out of service in the
         past three years. The associated work orders (WO) and control room logs were reviewed to
         determine whether the duration the breaker was out of service exceeded the Completion Times
         of TS 3.8.1 Conditions A and F ..On two occasions separate from the event being reported in
         this LER, E-CB-S/1 was taken out of service and the TS allowed outage time was exceeded.
         These two other events occurred on 11/2212010 and 813112011. A search was also performed on
         E-CB-1/7, E-CB-7/1, E-CB-3/8 and E-CB-8/3 being taken out of service from 2009-2012. There
         were 5 occurrences where SR was not completed. A similar search was performed on E-CB-S/3
         as it performs the same function as E-CB-S/1, but on Division 2. On 3/28/2011 E-CB-S/3 was
         taken out of service and the TS allowed outage time was exceeded.</previousEvents>
