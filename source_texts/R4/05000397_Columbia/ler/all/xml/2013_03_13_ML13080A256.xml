The breaker provides power to an essential bus from one of the credited offsite power sources. While E-CB-S/1 was out of service, Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) would not have been able to meet acceptance criteria in a surveillance procedure used to satisfy Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.1. Therefore, per SR 3.0.1 , failure to meet the surveillance requirement indicates that Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 was not met. The breaker was inoperable for approximately 30 hours, resulting in the failure to meet the Required Actions described in Condition A and F within the specified Completion Times. The apparent cause was determined to be conflicting information between the associated TS Bases and the surveillance procedure. The contributing cause was determined to be inadequate process for operability determinations when equipment is removed from service for maintenance activities or due to equipment failure. </TH></TR></Table><P>26158 R5 26158 R5 26158 R5 </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) u.s.

There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of this event and that contributed to this event. Description of Event On August 22, 2012, it was discovered that during maintenance on breaker E-CB-S/1 [BKR], required Technical Specification (TS) Action Statement (TSAS) 3.8.1 Condition A was not entered. The breaker provides power to the Division 1 critical electrical bus E-SM-7 [BU] from the credited offsite source, E-TR-S [XFMR]. It was discovered that while E-CB-S/1 was out of service, Columbia would not have been able to satisfy acceptance criteria in the associated surveillance procedure used to satisfy Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.1. Therefore, per SR 3.0.1, failure to meet the surveillance requirement indicates that Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 was not met. The breaker was inoperable for approximately 30 hours, resulting in the failure to meet the Required Actions described in TS 3.8.1 Condition A and F, within the specified Completion Times. Immediate Corrective Actions Night orders were initiated notifying operations personnel of the issue and the appropriate measures to take going forward when planning work with the associated breakers. Specifically, any work which impacts the ability of E-TR-S to supply power to the critical electrical bus for Division 1 or Division 2 will require entry into TS 3.8.1 Condition A. Causes The apparent cause was determined to be conflicting information between TS Bases 3.8.1 and the surveillance procedure. The contributing cause was determined to be an inadequate process for operability determinations when equipment is removed from service for maintenance activities or due to equipment failure. Further Corrective Actions The following corrective actions are planned or have been completed: • Develop methodology to be used by operations when making operability determinations for equipment removed from service. • Enhance procedures concerning operability determinations for equipment removed from service. • Initiate training requests to train operators on methodology to be used when making operability determinations for equipment removed from service. • Revise associated operations procedures based on TS Bases requirements. • Develop a formal position for offsite power requirements. • Conduct a focused self-assessment to ensure the adequacy of TS Bases and implementation of TS SRs. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Critical electrical buses E-SM-7 and E-SM-8 [BU] are normally energized from Normal Auxiliary transformer, E-TR-N1 [XFMR], when the main generator [GEN] is operating. Similar Events A search was performed for each time E-CB-S/1 was taken out of service in the past three years. The associated work orders (WO) and control room logs were reviewed to determine whether the duration the breaker was out of service exceeded the Completion Times of TS 3.8.1 Conditions A and F ..On two occasions separate from the event being reported in this LER, E-CB-S/1 was taken out of service and the TS allowed outage time was exceeded. These two other events occurred on 11/2212010 and 813112011. A search was also performed on E-CB-1/7, E-CB-7/1, E-CB-3/8 and E-CB-8/3 being taken out of service from 2009-2012. There were 5 occurrences where SR was not completed. A similar search was performed on E-CB-S/3 as it performs the same function as E-CB-S/1, but on Division 2. On 3/28/2011 E-CB-S/3 was taken out of service and the TS allowed outage time was exceeded.
