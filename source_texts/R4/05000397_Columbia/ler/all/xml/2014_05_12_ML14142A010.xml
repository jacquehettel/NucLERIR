The hold down bolts are required as part of the tornado missile barrier for the manhole cover for the underground electric vault. It was later determined that the hold down bolts for manhole cover E11 (Division 2 Service Water) had been identified as missing since September 6, 2013. When the bolts were identified as missing on September 6. 2013. the manhole cover and bolts were not recognized as a tornado missile barrier: because this information was not availabfe in routinely used databases and procedures. No Compensatory action was taken until March 12,2014. when large concrete blocks were placed on top of the manholes to prevent the covers from potential removal In the event of a tornado. The degraded miSsile barrier is considered to have rendered the Division 2 Service Water system Inoperable from September 6. 2013. to March 12. 2014. This Is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical SpecIfIcations. </TH></TR></Table><P>26158 R6 NRC FOnT! 366 (Ol-2014} </P><Table><TR><TH>HAC FOAM 3IIA (O1-201~1 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LJ:R) CONTINUAnON SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

There were no Inoperable plant systems at the time of discovery that contributed to this event. EVENT DESCAlPnON On March 12. 2014, it was identified that three manhole covers (E10, E11, and E 15) for vautts containing 4160 volt electric cables [Cell were missing the hold down botts. The electric cables in vautts E10 and E11 support the Division 2 Service Water [BI} system. The electric cables in vaults E15 support the Division 3 Service Water system. The hold down bofts are required as part of the tornado missile barrier for the manhole cover for the underground electric vault. It was later determined that the hold down bofts for manhole cover E11 (Division 2 Service Water) had been Identified as missing in two condition reports on September 6. 2013. and again on December 3, 2013. When Operations performed an immediate operability determination for the September and December 2013 condition reports, the manhofe cover and bofts were not recognized as a tornado missile barrier; therefore. no compensatory actton was taken until March 12, 2014. The degraded missile barrier is considered to have rendered the Division 2 Service Water system Inoperable from September 6,2013. to March 12,2014. This is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. IMMEDIATE COARECnYE ACTION It was verified through the Weather Service that no tornados were predicted for our area In the next 24 hours. Large concrete blocks were placed over the manhole covers on March 12. 2014. to prevent the cover from lifting In the event of a tornado. The Information fields in the master equipment list for the applicable manhole covers were completed Identifying them as a tornado missile barrier. CAUSE The Information In this section Is based on the preliminary results of a root cause evaluation. If any significant changes In the cause or corrective actions are rna'in the final evaluation, a suppJement will be submitted for this report. The direct cause for the missing hold down bolts was not determined. The root cause of the faHure to recognize the manhole cover as a tornado barrier was that station procedures that Implement the process to establish quality classifications for safety-retated systems. structures. and components (SSCs) did not ensure accurate Information was available In a timely manner for these components. There are multiple methods available for determining the safety significance of a degraded component; however, the computerized master equipment list is typically the preferred method. The equipment plant numbers (EPNs) for the manhole covers had been entered into master equipment list in 2012. but no action was taken to complete the remaining data fields for the components to identify that the manhole covers fulfHled a tornado barrier function, and have the information verified and approved. The master equipment list that station personnel used identified these manhole covers as nonsafety-retated. </TH></TR></Table><P>26168A R3 NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) </P><P>•

Most plant personnel, including Operations, did not recognize that the information In the computer master equipment list for the manhole covers was not at an approved status and should not be used. The manhole covers did not have any label indicating that It was a tornado missile barrier. Plant drawings did not identify the manhole covers 88 tornado missile barriers. Additionally, the station barrier Impairment procedure did not list the manhole covers as a tornado missile barrier. FURTHER CORREcnVE ACTION Work requests were inmated to repair/replace the missing bolts for the manhole covers. Revise Engineering procedures to provide clear direction to establISh Quality Classifications for safety-related SSCs within the Master Equipment List within a specific time frame. Ensure that procedures Include timeliness requirements for establishing and upgrading/downgrading EPNs for Installed plant equipment. Appfy a marking on the manhole covers that identify these covers as a tornado missile barrier. Revise the station barrier Impairment procedure to identify manhole covers as a tornado missile barrier. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES No actual tornados occurred during the time of interest. The Division 2 Service Water system remained capable of fulfHJing its safety function during this time period. AdditionaUy. at least one other division of Service Water was available during this time period (September 6,2013 to March 12, 2014) to be abfe to fulfill the safety function; therefore, the actual safety consequence of this Issue was minimal.
