On December 14, 2000, the plant was at 100% power. Containment Instrument Air (CIA) [LD,LK] system quarterly 
sampling was in progress, The pressure in CIA header 'A' and header 'B' began to decrease at approximately 2051. 
At approximately 2128 the pressure in the CIA system dropped to approximately 160 psig and caused the generation of 
a valid isolation signal to the 'B' CIA supply valve, CIA-V-39B [ISV], and the valve closed. This isolated the 'B' CIA 
header from the normal non safety-related nitrogen supply portion of the system, The closure of the isolation valve, in 
combination with the low pressure in the system, caused the safety-related portion of the CIA system to initiate and 
supply nitrogen gas to the system from the associated bank of nitrogen bottles, The pressure in header 'B' increased to 
184 psig (normal) within 3 minutes. This engineered safety feature (ESF) actuation provided the pneumatic supply to 
maintain operating pressure for the 'B' nitrogen supply header for the Automatic Depressurization System [SB], No 
other plant safety features were affected. The CIA system pressure dropped to a minimum pressure of approximately 
156 psig. 
</P><P>The 'A' CIA header did not isolate as the supply valve, CIA-V-39A, did not close when the system reached 160 psig, 
</P><P>There were no safety consequences associated with this event. This event is being reported in accordance with 
lOCFR50.73(a)(2)(iv) as an event or condition that resulted in an automatic actuation of an ESF. The actuation 
occurred while the isolation system was in service. 
</P><P>The NRC Operations Center was notified of the unexpected ESF actuation by means of the Emergency Notification 
System (ENS) at 0053 hours on December 15, 2000. The Event Number is 37599. 
</P><P>Immediate Corrective Action 
The quarterly test of the CIA system was secured, 
</P><P>Further Evaluation 
An incident review board (lRB) was established to investigate the event. The CIA sampling test equipment was 
inspected. The IRB determined the test equipment was configured as required by the test procedure. In addition, the 
testing was conducted in strict compliance with the test procedure, No abnormal nitrogen leakage or high use was 
detected. 
</P><P>The IRB determined the 'A' CIA header isolation valve, CIA-V-39A, did not close at 160 psig due to the as-found 
closure setpont to be 154 psig. The administrative limit for the setpoint is 158-165 psig. The as-found setpoint value 
was above the technical specification minimum allowable value of 151.4 psig. 
</P><P>The IRB also determined that a heater contactor on the nitrogen make-up trim vaporizer had failed. This failure caused 
the vaporizer to fail to maintain the nitrogen gas at or above 70°F. However, this failure alone should not have caused 
the nitrogen gas pressure reduction in the CIA system during this event. The heater contactor for the nitrogen gas 
make-up vaporizer was replaced on December 15, 2000, The CIA quarterly sampling procedure was successfully 
completed.

Additional component testing is planned. An investigation into the event did not reveal a reason for the system pressure decrease. Further Corrective Action The closure setpoint for valve CIA-V-39A was reset to its normal trip point of 160 psig. The need for further corrective action will be assessed based on component test results. Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no safety consequences associated with this event. Failures of the non safety-related portions of the system have minimal safety significance and will not cause plant transients. The ESF portion of the system actuated and maintained the pneumatic supply and pressure as designed. The event did not involve a loss of intended safety function. In addition, the event did not involve an event or condition that alone could have prevented the fulfillment of any safety functions described in IOCFRSO.73(a)(2)(v). Similar Events There has not been a similar event within the last five years. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
