ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, I.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) (16) At 1953 on November 4, 2003, with the plant in mode 1, it was determined that a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident had existed on November 1,2003. This condition occurred when the normal and both remote outside air intakes for the Control Room Emergency Filtration (CREF) [VI] system were manually isolated for a period of approximately 4 hours during '. testing to measure control room in-leakage. In this configuration, the CREF system cannot perform its design safety function to pressurize the main control room with filtered air as described in Columbia's accident analysis. When this discovery was made, the CREF system was in a normal standby configuration and the test procedure was revised to remove the errant steps. The inoperable CREF condition is also reportable as an event where a single condition caused two independent trains to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The cause of this event is attributed to inadequate preparation and review of the test procedure used to measure con~rol room in-leakage. The review did not identify that the procedure directed test personnel to place the CREF system in a configuration that would prevent the system from performing its design safety function. There were no safety consequences associated with the inoperable CREF system and this event did not represent an actual loss of a safety function for greater than the time allowed by Technical Specifications. </Figure><P>26158 R1 </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) IREVISION </TD><TD>PAGE (3) 20F3</TD></TR><TR><TH>Columbia Generating Station </TH><TD>05000397 </TD><TD>YEAR 1SEQUENTIAL NUMBER NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TD>2003-012-00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>NARRAnVE (Ifmore space is required, use additional copies ofNRC Form 366A) (17) Event Description At 1953 on November 4,2003, with the plant in mode 1, it was determined that a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident had existed on November 1, 2003 when testing was conducted to measure control room in-leakage. The test employed tracer gas methodology and was not a routine surveillance test. A review of plant records indicated the normal and both remote outside air intakes for the Control Room Emergency Filtration (CREF) [VI] system were manually isolated for a period of approximately 4 hours. In this configuration, the CREF system cannot perform its design safety function to pressurize the main control room with filtered air as described in Columbia's accident analysis. The inoperable CREF condition is also reportable as an event where a single condition caused two independent trains to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Immediate Corrective Action The discovery of the prohibited CREF configuration was made during a review of test documents after the test was concluded. At that time, the CREF system was in a normal standby configuration and the test procedure was revised to remove the errant steps. Root Cause The cause of this event is attributed to inadequate preparation and review of the special test procedure used to measure control room in-leakage with the tracer gas methodology. The review did not identify that, contrary to Columbia's design and licensing basis, the procedure directed test personnel to place the CREF system in a configuration that would prevent the system from performing its design safety function. Further Corrective Action The procedure review process will be revised to explicitly require verification that proposed procedures and proposed procedure revisions will not be inconsistent with Columbia's design and licensing documents. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) u.s.

Additionally, this event did not represent an actual loss of a safety function for greater than the time allowed by Technical Specifications. Similar Events There have been no previous similar events in which a condition reportable pursuant to 10 CFR § 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) or 10 CFR § 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) existed due to a prohibited system configuration allowed by a plant procedure. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
