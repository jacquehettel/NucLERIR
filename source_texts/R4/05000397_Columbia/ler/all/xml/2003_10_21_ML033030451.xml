With E-B2-1 inoperable, TSs require the supported features ofE-B2-1 to'be inimediatelY declared inoperable. RCIC:V19, the RCIC pump minimum flow bypass valve, is a containment isolation valve. RCIC-V-19 is also supported by battery E-B2-1. RCIC-V-19 was declared inoperable, and was closed and deactivated to comply with plant TSs. Because RCIC-V-19 was inoperable, operators isolated the steam inlet valve (RCIC-V-1) to the RCIC turbine to prevent operation of the RCIC system. The isolation of the RCIC system is reported as an event or condition that could prevent the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Upon replacement of the battery cell, E-B2-1 was restored to service, and the RCIC system was declared operable at 1700 PDT on August 22,2003. </Figure><P>26158 R2 </P><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><P>.

E-B2-1 had been declared inoperable due to failure of one battery cell to meet Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.6, Battery Cell Parameters, Table 3.8.6-1, Category C specific gravity limits.----------;-: -~-------------.-~~-.----------------. ------.---~ With E-B2-1 inoperable, TS 3.8.4, DC Sources -Operating, Required Action C.1, requires the equipment supported by the inoperable battery to be immediately declared inoperable. RCIC-V-19, the RCIC pump minimum flow bypass valve, is a primary containment isolation valve (peIV). RCIC-V-19 is also supported by battery E-B2-1. RCIC-V-19 was declared inoperable, and was closed and deactivated to comply with TS 3.6.1.3, Primary Containment Isolation Valves, Required Action C.l. Because RCIC-V-19 was inoperable, operators closed the steam inlet valve (RCIC-V-1) to the RCIC turbine to prevent operation of the RCIC system. Isolation of RCIC-V-1 removes RCIC from service . .Cause of Event ---The isolation and removal from service of'flieRCIC system was.a result of declarIng E-B2-1 and associated support features (including RCIC-V-19) inoperable, as required by the plant's Technical Specifications. To prevent operation of the RCIC system with RCIC-V-19 closed and deactivated, it was necessary to isolate the steam inlet valve (RCIC-V-l) to the RCIC turbine. ' /' . '&quot; '. The reason 'ror declaring .E~B2-1.inoperable .was.the discovery th(i! JheJiPecifi~.gravi~-2f.!h_e___ electrolyte in E-B2-1 cell number 166 did not meet the TS Table 3.8.6-1 Category C battery cell parameter requ~rements.. · This TS table specifies that no connected battery cell electrolyte specific gravity maY&quot;be more than 0.020 below the average of all the connected cells of that battery. The root cause is thought to be less than adequate battery recharging following the 5year modified discharge test during the most recent refueling outa~e. Safety Significance The RCIC system is designed to operate either manually or automatically following a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) isolation accompanied by a loss of coolant flow from the feedwater system to provide adequate core cooling and control of RPV water level. Under these conditions, the High Pressure Core.Spray (HPCS) and RCIC systems perform similar </TH></TR></Table><P>26158 R2 26158 R2 </P><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET(2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) YEAR I SEQUENTIAL IREVISION NUMBER NUMBER </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TH>Columbia Generating Station </TH><TD>05000397 </TD><TD>30F3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2003~'()() </TD></TR><TR><TH>functions. During the entire time the RCIC system was inoperable, the High Pressure Core Spray System was available. Therefore, it is concluded that this event posed no threat to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(v)(D). -Corrective Actions Upon replacement of the battery cell that did not meet the TS battery cell parameter requirements, the 250 VDC battery (E-B2-1) was restored to service, and the RCIC system was declared operable at 1700 PDT on August 22, 2003. The battery discharge and quarterly operability surveillance procedures will be revised to include directions to place the battery on equalize for two 5-day periods (separated by a 2-day period) following perfonnance of the surveillance. Previous Similar Events On July 8, 2003, the RCIC system was declared inoperable after one of its steam supply containment isolation valves was inadvertently closed during the perfonnance of a surveillance test. The surveillance test was discontinued and plant operators verified that the High Pressure Core Spray system was operable. The RCIC system was restored to its nonnal standby lineup and declared operable within one hour. The details concerning this event are discussed in LER 397-2003-008. -,'&quot;&quot; -.-----..---------.... ~ -----~--. -. .. -~-..
