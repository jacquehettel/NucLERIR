This report is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by technical specifications. The enclosed report discusses items of reportability and corrective actions taken. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Mr. GV Cullen at (509) 377-6105. Enclosure: Licensee Event Report 2005-005-00 cc: BS Mallett -	NRC RIV BJ Benney-NRC NRR INPO Records Center NRC Sr. Resident Inspector -988C (2) RN Sherman -BPAl1399 WA Horin -Winston &Strawn CE Johnson -NRC RIVlfax 26158 R2 ". , NRC FORM 366A  U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION  (1-2001)  LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)  1.

NARRATIVE (If more space Is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) PLANT CONDITION The plant was operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent power at the time of this event. EVENT DESCRIPTION On July 6, 2005 preventive maintenance was performed on the motor control center [MCC] bucket for Standby Liquid Control (SLC) System [BR] Pump [P] 1A, which included fuse [FU] replacement. During the evolution, the existing time delay fuse was replaced with a standard quick blow fuse. On July 28, 2005 a subsequent review of the fuse control log identified that the replacement fuse was incorrect and a work request (WR) was generated to correct the condition. Operations reviewed this WR and questioned the effect of this condition on the operability of the pump. This concern was immediately investigated and it was determined this configuration did not meet the electrical design requirements of the pump. The pump was subsequently declared inoperable. The fuse was promptly replaced and the pump was restored to an operable status at 0137 hours on July 29, 2005. This condition resulted in the pump being inoperable for a period of approximately 22.5 days. Since this period of inoperability is longer than the seven day Completion Time provided in the Columbia Technical Specification 3.1.7 for one inoperable SLC subsystem, this condition is reported as a condition prohibited by the technical specifications pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i){B). IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION The SLC Pump 1A was restored to operable status on July 29,2005 by replacing the fuse with the correct type. The corresponding fuse in the opposite train, SLC Pump 1 B, was verified to be the correct fuse. Energy Northwest performed a review of the fuse replacements for the last two years. CAUSE The root cause of this event is an inadequate self verification process combined with a less than adequate implementing procedure for controlling the fuse replacement process. á ' NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)  1.

PAGE 30F3  2005-005-00  FURTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION Interim action: Revise PPM 1.3.47 to require "exact for exact" fuse replacement (amps, voltage, and model/type). If an alternate fuse must be used, then a supervisor or appropriate engineering personnel must verify that the replacement fuse is the correct type. Additional corrective actions will be taken as developed in PER 205-0502 of the Energy Northwest Corrective Action Program. -¥-ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES This event posed no threat to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. A risk assessment was performed on this condition. For a condition of the SLC Pump 1A being inoperable for a period of 23 days, a delta core damage probability (~CDP) of 1.78E-7 was calculated. The calculated ~CDP is well below the threshold of a safety significant condition and is therefore not safety significant. The SLC System is not credited for the mitigation of design basis events. The SLC System satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 50.62. Per 10 CFR 50.62, the purpose of the SLC System is to reduce the risk associated with a postulated anticipated transient without a scram. The SLC System was not designed to meet the single failure criteria. The remaining SLC Pump would have been capable of injecting the entire contents of the boric acid storage tank. This condition is not considered to be a safety system functional failure. SIMILAR EVENTS No recent similar events have been reported at Columbia. Following the identification of this condition, a review to assess the extent of condition was performed. Several conditions involving incorrect fuses were identified. None of these instances represented a reportable condition or an operability concern. EllS information denoted as [XX]
