REVISION LErR NUMBER (6) I :~UMBER NUMBERYEAR  PAGE (3)  Columbia Generating Station  ~~ . 05000397  20F4  2003-005-00  NARRATIVE (ffmote space Is tequited, use additional copies ofNRC Form 366A) (17) Event Description On June 16, 2003, Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) was in Mode 4 (cold shutdown) with the reactor coolant temperature at approximately 112 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 1330 PDT. an isolation of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Cooling (SDC) common suction header occurred when the outboard primary containment isolation valve, RHR-V-8 closed. The RHR SOC isolation occurred while performing surveillance procedure TSP-CONTIISOL-B501, "Containment Isolation LSFf," [Logic System Functional Test] section 7.6; Manual Initiation. Step 7 .6.42 of this surveillance procedure required depressing the manual Nuclear Steam Supply Shutoff System (NSSSS) initiation logic B pushbutton (MS-RMS-S25B). Depressing this pushbutton causes an isolation signal to 16 NSSSS isolation valves, including RHR-V-8. At the time of the event, RHR SDC subsystem A was operating in the shutdown cooling mode and RHR SDC subsystem B was available for SDC service, but not in operation. Reactor Recirculation Pump IB (RRC-P-IB) was running to support reactor core circulation and was unaffected by the RHR SDC isolation. The condensate system was available as an alternate means of decay heat removal by injection into the RPV with heat rejection to the main condenser. -The SDC isolation was caused by closure ofRHR-V-8, the outboard primary containment isolation valve in the common. suction line for both RHR SDC subsystems. ClOsure of RHR-V-8 subsequently tripped RHR SDC pump 2A (RHR-P-2A). Operators entered abnormal condition procedure ABN¥RHR-SDC-LOSS, "Loss of Shutdown Cooling," and the appropriate Technical Specification (TS) Required Action (TS 3.4.tO.A). Technical Specification Required Action 3.4. to.A. t requires verifICation that an alternate source of decay heat removal is available for each inoperable RHR SDC subsystem within one hour. All isolation sigDats were reset and RHR SOC was restored approximately 12 minutes after RHR-V-8 closed. During the time that RHR SDC was out of service, reactor coolant temperature increased from approximately 112 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Cause of Event The primary cause of this event was an inadequate procedure. Surveillance procedure TSP¥CONTIISOL-B501, section 7.6, should have contained a description of the expected valve isolations that would occur when the manual pushbutton forNSSSS initiation logic B was depressed. Other sections of this procedure do contain descriptions ofexpected isolations, while section 7.6 does not. A contributing cause was inadequate preparation by the operators performing the test. Even though the surveillance procedure was weak in describing the impact on the plant.when performing section 7.6, a more thorough review to understand the impact of the test being performed may have prevented this event.  '. ";:'~. NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)  FACILITY NAME (1)  DOCKET(2) ,  YEAR SEQUENTIAL REVISIONr LER NUMBER (6) I NUMBER NUMBER  PAGE (3)  Columbia Generating Station  05000397  40F4   An isolation of shutdown cooling occured on June 8.2001 when the RHR suction outboard isolation valve closed during planned maintenance.
