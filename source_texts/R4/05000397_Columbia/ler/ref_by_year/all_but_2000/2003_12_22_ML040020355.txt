The vulnerability existed due to a safeguards information (SGI) container being unlocked and unattended for a period of approximately six days. The unlocked container could have allowed unauthorized or undetected access to site-specific technical details regarding the physical security system that could facilitate access to the protected and vital areas. Subsequent to discovery of the vulnerability, the contents of the SGI container were reviewed and did not appear to be changed or altered. The SGI container is located in a records vault for which access is controlled with a combination lock. The vault entrance is in full view of records management specialists throughout the workday. The vault is open only when records management specialists are in the direct vicinity to view the vault. There was no evidence of forced entry into the records vault or the SGI container. In addition, the vulnerable condition did not result in an unauthorized or undetected entry into Columbia's protected or vital areas. This 60-day follow-up written report is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 73.71(b)(2) and 10 CFR 73.71(a)(4). Regulatory Guide 5.62, Revision 1, Section 3.2, instructs licensees to use NRC Licensee Event Report form 366, and describes the report content that is sufficient for NRC analysis and evaluation. Because this event did not involve a security system failure or a threat related incident, only items 1 through 14 in section 3.2 of Regulatory Guide 5.62, Revision 1, are addressed below: Date and Time of Event The SGI container was left unlocked from approximately 1215 hours on Friday, October 17, 2003, to approximately 1415 hours on October 23,2003, PDT. Location of Actual or Threatened Event The open SGI container is located in a plant records storage vault. The vault is in the records processing area of a building adjacent to Columbia's protected area and within the owner controlled area. The vault entrance is in full view of records management specialists throughout the workday. The vault is open only when records management specialists are in the direct vicinity to view the vault.  NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) u.s. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)  FACILITY NAME (1)  DOCKET(2)  LER NUMBER161  PAGE (3) 30F4 Columbia Generating Station  00050397  YEAR I SEQUENTIALNUMBER NUMBER IREVISION  2003-011-00  Plant Operating Phase At the time of event discovery, Columbia Generating Station was in Mode 1 and operating at 100% reactor power. Safety Systems Threatened, Directly or Indirectly Because the vulnerability did not result in an unauthorized entry into a protected or vital area, no safety systems were threatened. TyPe of Security Force Onsite Columbia Generating Station maintains a proprietary security force. Number and Type of Personnel Involved Two bargaining employees and a document designer were involved in this event. All three were safeguards approved for the container that was left unlocked. Method of Discovery of Vulnerability On October 23, 2003, a records management specialist was showing a document designer the location of the SGI container located inside the records vault. When the two employees approached the container, the records management specialist observed the combination lock lying on top of the container. The document designer informed an administrative services supervisor who confIrmed the container was not locked, secured the container, and informed the Security Department. Procedural Errors Involved On October 17, 2003, a records management specialist left the SGI container unlocked and unattended. Leaving an unlocked SGI container unattended was a violation of security procedure SWP-SEC-02, "Protection of Safeguards Information." Immediate Actions Taken in Response to the Vulnerability Upon discovery of the combination lock lying on top of the SGI container, an administrative services supervisor secured the container and informed the Security Department. Security personnel inspected the container and determined that the contents of the container did not appear to be changed or altered.  .... ,'\ NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)  FACILITY NAME (1)  DOCKET (2)  LER NUMBER (6) I REVISION  PAGE (3) 40F4 Columbia Generating Station  00050397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL NUMBER NUMBER  2003-011-00  Corrective Actions Taken or Planned The employee responsible for leaving the SGI container unlocked is no longer approved to access SGI, and the combination to the SGI container has been changed. In addition, a time-out was conducted with administrative services personnel to stress the seriousness of this event, and the need to preclude the recurrence of a similar event. A two-person rule has been implemented which requires two people to verify that an SGI container has been opened or closed. Visible signs will also be placed on an SGI container to indicate when it is open or closed. Lastly, as a result of industry bench-marking, inventories will be maintained for SGI containers, and a log will be maintained when items are removed or restored to an SGI container. Local, State, or Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Contacted No local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies were contacted regarding this condition. Description of Media Interest or Press Release A press release was not issued regarding this condition and there has been no media interest. Indication of Previous Similar Events A similar event occurred at Columbia on May 15,2003, as reported to the NRC by a 30-day follow-up report dated June 13,2003.
