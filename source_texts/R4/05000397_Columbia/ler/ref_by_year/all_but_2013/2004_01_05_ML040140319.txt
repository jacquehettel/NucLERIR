The test employed tracer gas methodology and was not a routine surveillance test. A review of plant records indicated the normal and both remote outside air intakes for the Control Room Emergency Filtration (CREF) [VI] system were manually isolated for a period of approximately 4 hours. In this configuration, the CREF system cannot perform its design safety function to pressurize the main control room with filtered air as described in Columbia's accident analysis. The inoperable CREF condition is also reportable as an event where a single condition caused two independent trains to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Immediate Corrective Action The discovery of the prohibited CREF configuration was made during a review of test documents after the test was concluded. At that time, the CREF system was in a normal standby configuration and the test procedure was revised to remove the errant steps. Root Cause The cause of this event is attributed to inadequate preparation and review of the special test procedure used to measure control room in-leakage with the tracer gas methodology. The review did not identify that, contrary to Columbia's design and licensing basis, the procedure directed test personnel to place the CREF system in a configuration that would prevent the system from performing its design safety function. Further Corrective Action The procedure review process will be revised to explicitly require verification that proposed procedures and proposed procedure revisions will not be inconsistent with Columbia's design and licensing documents.  NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) u.s.

Additionally, this event did not represent an actual loss of a safety function for greater than the time allowed by Technical Specifications. Similar Events There have been no previous similar events in which a condition reportable pursuant to 10 CFR ¤ 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) or 10 CFR ¤ 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) existed due to a prohibited system configuration allowed by a plant procedure.
