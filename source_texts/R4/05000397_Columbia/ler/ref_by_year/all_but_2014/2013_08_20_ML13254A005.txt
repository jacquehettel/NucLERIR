EXPECTEDSUBMISSIONOATE) a On June 27, 2013 at 17:58 hours a laborer was exiting the Clesel Generator [00] 3 Room when he Inadvertently brushed against the control switch (JS) for the Diesel Mixed Air fan [FAN} causing it to tum to the OFF position. In response to an annunciator alarm in the main control room, an operations supervisor proceeded to the Oiesel Generator 3 Room. After ascertaining what had happened by questioning the laborer, the operator turned the fan control switch back to ON and the switch operated smoothly. The Diesel Mixed Air fan was back In service at 18:19 hOUTS. so the fan was inoperable for approximately 21 minutes. With the Diesel Mixed Air fan switch in the OFF position. the following supported equipment were declared inoperable and the appropriate Technical Speclflcatlons were entered: Diesel Generator 3. High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) [BJ1. Division 3125 VDC battery charger {BYC], Division 3 battery (BTRY], and the Division 3 AC electrical power distribution system [JX). The loss of the HPCS system resulted In the temporary toss of safety function for a single train system. There was no radiological retease associated with this event. No safety system actuations or isolations occurred. The licensee notified the NRC Resident Inspector and Event Notification No. 49152 was submitted. 26158 R5 NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET  1.

In response to an annunciator In the main control room, an operations SUPervisor proceeded to the DIesel Generator 3 Room. After ascertaining what had happened by questioning the laborer, the operator tumed the fan control switch back to the ON position. The Diesel Mixed Alt fan was back in service at 18:19 hours, so the fan was Inoperable for approximately 21 minutes. Technical Specifications were entered for the foHowing equipment supported by the fan and declared inoperable: High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) [BJ], Diesel Generator (00-3) (OG], Division 3 125 VOC battery charger (BYC], Division 3 125 VDC battery (BTRy], and the Division 3 AC electrical powel distribution system (JX]. The Diesel Mixed Air fan and its supported equipment and systems were declared operable at 18:19 hours and retumed to service. The event affected the safety function for 8 single trafn system, the High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) system; therefore, this Licensee Event report is flied in accordance with 10 CFR 5O.73(a)(2)(v)(8) and SO.13(a}(2)(v)(D). There were no radiological releases because of 11118 event, and there were no system actuatiOns or isolations as 8 result of the event. IMMEDIATE CORRECT1VE ACTION The proper control switch position was restored and the fan (OMA·FN-32) was placed back into service by Operations personnel. CAUSE The cause Evaluation Identified the apparent cause of this event as ineffective Implementation of error prevention tools. A contributing cause was Identified as the station not having adequately addressed poor human factor deSigns in some cases for components susceptible to inadvertent contact due to their location and proximity in the plant. FURTHER CORAECTNE ACTION Conduct a briefing with Site Support Contractor craft workers focusing on procedure PPM 1.3.81 (Maintaining Plant Component Status Control) requirements and supporting behaviors. Perform plant walk-downs and compile a list of components that are susceptible to bumping and provide recommendations for additional actions to prevent bump incidents. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The Diesel Mixed Air fan DMA·FN-32 functions as part of the 00-3 Engine Room ventilation supplying air flow to the room's air handling unit, and supports maintaining room air temperatures for diesel generator operation and for protection of electrical equipment. The fan serves the electrical equipment and generator area which .are normaUy in standby. This HVAC component is required to ensure long"term emergency diesel generator and HPCS system operations. The HPCS system and Diesel Generator 3 were at/II available to respond to an accident condition. this event had no Impact to the health and safety of the public.  26158 RS 26158 RS NRC FORM 368A (10-2010) u.s.
