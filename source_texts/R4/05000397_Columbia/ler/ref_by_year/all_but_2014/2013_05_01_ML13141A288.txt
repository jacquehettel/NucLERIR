The methodology for the existing surveillance had been in use since 1998 around the time Energy Northwest converted to the Improved Technical Specifications. T8 SR 3.0.3 was Invoked and a new surveillance procedure was developed. On March 2, 2013, while perfonning the new surveillance procedure, the test results revealed that the air handler thermal performance for the MAn train did not meet the acceptance criteria. this failure to satisfy SR 3.7.4.1 in March. following entry Into SR 3.0.3, is reportable under 10 CFR 5O.73(a)(2)(i)(9) -Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's technical specifications. The control room AC subsystem has been cleaned, retested, and returned to operable status. 26158 R5 NRC FORM 388A (1 ()'2010) u.s.

EVENT DESCRlP110N In October 2012, it was determined that the Technical Specification (TS) surveiHanoe procedure to verify that each control room air conditioning (AC) subsystem (VI) has the capabHtty to remove the assumed heat load for TS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.4.1 did not satisfy the surveillance requirement. The methodology for the existing survelllance had been in use since 1998 around the time Energy Northwest converted to the Improved Technical Specifications. T8 SR 3.0.3 was Invoked. An informational test was perfonned on November 3,2012, indicating acceptable pelformance of the cooter lelR). A new surveillance procedure was developed and on March 2, 2013. whOe performing the new surveiHance, the test results revealed that the air handler thermal perfonnance for the "Aft train did not meet the acceptance criteria. This faUure to satisfy'SR 3.7.4.1 in March, following entry into SR 3.0.3, is reportable under 10 eFA 5O.73(a)(2)(I)(8) -Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's technical specifications. IMMEDIATE CORAEcnve ACTION ¥ Addition of Hydrogen Pero)(ld& to the service water spray ponds to kill biological material in the cooling water. ¥ Cleaning and Inspection of the air Side of the cooling coils. ¥ Cleaning. flushing and inspection of the water side of the cooling coits (CCl) ¥ Adjustment of the water flow to balance coil flow and heat removal capacity. A finat performance of the test on March 21, 2013 demonstrated heat removal capacity significantly above the minimum acceptance criteria. CAUSE The direct cause was determined to be macro-fouling of the water side of the tubes. The presence of large anode deposits, due to degradation of the zinc sacrificial anode. and sediment In the tower tubes of the cooling coils were blocking flow. The apparent cause was tack of a periodic performance test. With no component specific periodic performance test specified timely identtflcation of degradation. and subsequent action to mitigate the degradation. was not possible to prevent component faUure. No routine surveiHance on this cooler had been performed for '16 years. . , Contributing to this failure was a lack of procedural guidance to balance flow through the cooling coils. The control room coolers are unique in that they are the only doubte coli coolers used for service water systems [Bll. There Is no flow indication for the individual COils. only the total flow. Thermal performance testing found that flow was not properly balanced between the coils. Another contributing cause was a general Increase in the sediment levels of the service water system.  26158 RS 4 ' .

The main control room air coolers are required to have a minimum efficiency of 65% to provide the required cooling for a design basis event. In November 2012, the measured effic4ency of the "A" train AC was 67% as obtained by a maintenance test. The measured efficiency for the "A" train AC in March 2013 was 62.6%. The "8" train AC efficiency was greater than 65%. The "B" train AC was fully capable of maintaining required control room temperatures. The "A" train AC was still capable of providing adequate cootlng for most situations. Since November 2012 the "S" train was not been available for service on three occasions each with an outage duration of less than 1 day. During these times the MA" train would still have been capable of maintaining the control room within the required limits due to actual conditions being signlficantty less than design basis conditions (ambient temperature of 105¡F and service water temperature of noF). In addition to the coolers utiliZing service water, the main control room AC subsystem also has the capability to be aligned to emergency chillers (KMJ, which provide additional cooling capability. Each diviSion of the main control room air handier has two sets of coolers. One emergency cooler and one for normal HVAC. Both emergency coolers can be lined up to either servtce water or an emergency chiller, a clean ctosed-toop system. Typically, the flA" train Is "ned up to service water and the fiB" train to an emergency chiller. The safety significance of one main control room cooler having a slightly reduced efficiency was minimal. SIMILAR EVENTS A review of various databases at Columbia found no simHar issues of a component not being tested per surveillance. ENERGY INDUSTRY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (EllS) INFORMA11ON CODEe EUS COdes are twacketad 0...applicable in the narrative. 26158 RS
