LICENSEE EVENT REPORT NO. 2011-004-00 
Dear Sir or Madam: Transmitted herewith is Licensee Event Report No. 2011-004-00 for Columbia Generating Station. This report is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). The enclosed report discusses items of reportability and corrective actions taken related to an event which occurred December 10, 2011 that caused secondary containment differential pressure to exceed Technical Specification limits for a short period of time due to ice buildup and subsequent release from reactor building air filters. There are no commitments being made to the NRC by this letter. If you have any 
questions or require additional information, please contact Mr. ZK Dunham at (509) 377¥4735.

ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On 12110/11, secondary containment was declared inoperable due to differential pressure exceeding technical specification allowable limits for a period of approximately two minutes. While technical specification limits were exceeded the resulting excursion was bounded by analytical results and thus there were no safety consequences for this event. The cause for the event was determined to be ice buildup and subsequent release on exterior air filters supplying the reactor building HVAC system. Corrective actions will enhance standard operating procedures for cold weather operations to lower the threshold at which positive steps are taken to mitigate potential for icing on filters. 26158 R5 ..NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET  1.

Therewere.no structures, systems, or components thatwere inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Reactor building exhaust [VL] was in a normal alignment with REA-FN-1A, one of two 100 percentácapacity exhaust fans [FAN], running with REA-FN-1 B in standby condition. Reactor building exhaust filters [FL T] had been observed to be icing over due to adverse environmental conditions (the area had been under a deep freeze since 12/8/11 and humidity was approximately 90 percent for this same time period) and steps had been taken to monitor the filters and advance roll filters on a more frequent basis. Event Description The control room received a high secondary containmentdifferential pressure alarm on 12110/11 at 04:43. The pressure excursion resulted in a peak pressure of approximately. 0.03 inches water gauge and an unplanned entry into LCO 3.6.4.1 A. In response to the alarm, Operations swapped from REA-FN-1 A and ROA-FN-1 A to REA-FN-1 Band ROA-FN-1 B. Reactor Exhaust Air (REA) Differential Pressure (DP) controller [VA], REA¥DPIC-1A was then able to maintain Reactor Building pressure below the Technical Specification (TS) limit of¥0.25 inches water gauge after two minutes, as designed. This event is reportable as an event that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to control the release of radiation and mitigate the consequences of an accident per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) & 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). A 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) notification was made via Event Number 47516. Note that the original Event Notification incorrectly listed the event time as 04:56, review of plant data after the fact confirmed the actual time the TS limit was exceeded was 04:43. Immediate Corrective Actions The shift manager authorized a verbal procedure change to SOP-COLDWEATHER-OPS to allow for cutting of the roll filter of Reactor Building Outside Air (ROA) during extreme cold conditions when it was recognized that existing guidance in the procedure was insufficient to counter the ongoing conditions. Assessment of Safety Consequences This event resulted in an unplanned entry into LCO 3.6.4.1 A. Containment pressure was above -0.25 inches water gauge for approximately two minutes. The actual pressure response of secondary containment [NH] during this event was bounded by existing drawdown and dose analyses and thus there are no actual safety consequences to this event. Cause of Event The DP decrease was caused by buildup and subsequent release of ice on the ROA filter and bird screen allowing an increased amount of air to be pulled into the Reactor Building [NG] in a short amount of time. The resulting rapid pressure transient was on a time scale shorter than that which the flow controllers [TC] could respond.  r----------------------------------------------------------------------------~--~~

Both events occurred in December 2008, but neither resulted in exceeding TS allowable differential pressure on secondary containment. Further Corrective Actions Additional corrective actions will formalize enhancements to SOP-COLDWEATHER-OPS made as immediate corrective actions as well as to include precautions about conditions of high humidity and low temperatures and to lower the threshold for advancing roll filters with observed icing. .
