EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE) 181 NO  ABSTRACT On February 8, 2009 at 1125 hours, an automatic reactor scram occurred while Columbia was operating in Mode 1 at 75% power. The Digital Electro-Hydraulic (DEH) Control System emergency trip header momentarily depressurized' during testing following on-line quadvoter valve assembly replacement. A Turbine Governor Valve Fast Closure trip signal was generated and a reactor scram occurred. . ; . The direct cause of the event was the introduction of air into the DEH system during quadvoter valve replacement and subsequent compression of the unvented, entrapped air during post maintenance testing. The compression resulted in backflow and excursion of the trip header pressure below the trip setpoint. The root cause is design deficiencies in the on-line serviceable quadvoter assembly which allowed system conditions that resulted in a reactor trip following performance of on-line maintenance activities. Both quadvoter valve assemblies in the affected channel were replaced. Prior to reactor startup, the DEH system was vented and tested to ensure removal of all air. Corrective actions to address quadvoter design deficiencies and to improve quadvoter performance are being pursued . .~ This event did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public. Since the installation of a new DEH system at Columbia in 2007, one similar event was reported by Energy Northwest in LER 2008-001-00.  \ NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

Event Description On January 29, 2009, Ouadvoter "B" (DEH-SV-TRIP/B) failed during performance of weekly surveillance testing of the solenoid valves in the DEH system [JJ] quadvoter hydraulic trip block [HCU]. The quadvoter valve assemblies are designed for on-line repair and Columbia Licensee Controlled Specifications Surveillance Requirements require a failed channel be returned to operable status within 14 days. On February 8,2009, Ouadvoter "B" was isolated, replaced, vented, and unisolated in accordance with maintenance work instructions. Weekly surveillance testing was performed as the prescribed post maintenance testing prior to returning the quadvoter channel to operable status. During this testing, the DEH . system experienced pressure transients and the trip header of the quadvoter valves momentarily depressurized below the Turbine Governor Valve Fast Closure trip setpoint. Both Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] trip systems received reactor trip signals and, at 1125 PST, a full scram of the reactor [RCT] occurred. All rods fully inserted as expected in response to the RPS actuation and heat removal through the main condenser [SG] was maintained. A reactor water level 3 isolation occurred with the minimum level attained being zero inches. Post trip reactor vessel water level was maintained in the normal band using the feedwater [SJ] and condensate systems [SD] and pressure was controlled in the normal band using the bypass valves and main steam line drains. No other safety systems actuated or were required to actuate. There was no inoperable equipment at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Off-site power was available and three emergency diesel generators [EK] were operable and available. Crew recognition, response, and decision making enabled effective management of the transient. At 1808 EST (1508 PST), the NRC was notified of the RPS actuation per 10 CFR50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) (reference event notification number 44839). This LER is submitted pursuant to 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event or condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system. Immediate Corrective Action· Following the event, testing was performed to determine the cause of the scram. With the reactor shutdown in Mode 4, Ouadvoter "B" was again replaced, vented per instructions provided for on-line replacement, and the weekly surveillance testing re-performed. During the testing, pressure measurements of the trip header were conducted. The weekly surveillance testing independently de-energizes and re-energizes the solenoid valves to demonstrate proper operation. A pressure transient occurred when Ouadvoter "B" was re-energized causing the trip header pressure to momentarily drop below trip point limits. The testing illustrated that the DEH system was not completely vented of air. .  ,.. NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET  1. FACILITY NAME  2. DOCKET  6. LER NUMBER  3. PAGE  Columbia Generating Station  05000397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL I NUMBER REV NO.  30F4  2009 •001 -00  Cause The direct cause of the scram was the compression of unvented, entrapped air in the DEH system following maintenance which mom'entarilY depressurized the trip header. Air introduced into the inter-valve cavity line between Ouadvoter "An (DEH-SV-TRIP/A) and Quadvoter "s" serial pair during the replacement was incapable of being vented due to system design. When Quadvoter "sn was re-energized, the air was aligned with the trip header which resulted in backflow and momentary depressurization. The root cause of the event was design deficiencies in the on-line serviceable quadvoter valve assembly which allowed system conditions that resulted in a reactor trip following performance of on-line maintenance activities. Several contributing causes were identified: 1) The quadvoter solenoid valves which require on-line replacement are experiencing high failure rates. The failures are attributable to the degradation of the DEH Fyrquel fire-retardant hydraulic fluid due to excessive heat from the pilot valve coils of the quadvoter solenoid valve assemblies. 2) Inadequate Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) did not determine a design deficiency existed prior to plant installation. 3) The trip header does not have a pressure monitoring system for evaluating trip header response during routine and post maintenance testing. Further Corrective Action Quadvoter "A" was replaced to ensure both valves in at least one DEH trip channel were new. With the reactor shutdown in Mode 4, the system was operated and vented until testing verified no air remained entrapped and no significant pressure transients resulted from solenoid valve operation. Temporary cooling fans have been installed at the Ouadvoter assembly to reduce hydraulic fluid heating. Additional valve cycling during the weekly surveillance is being performed to facilitate hydraulic fluid exchange in the solenoids and reduce the potential for valve sticking. These actions provide greater system reliability for operation until the next scheduled outage (R-19, May -June 2009) when design modifications to prevent recurrence will be implemented. To permit future on-line replacement of quadvoter valve assemblies, design modifications to the DEH system are being assessed and prepared for implementation during the R-19 outage. The modifications will allow venting of the DEH system following maintenance, prevent depressurization of the trip header during pressure transients, provide quadvoter solenOids that operate within the normal temperature· range of the DEH hydraulic fluid, and provide a pressure monitoring system for the trip header. Until completion of the modifications, on•line replacement of quadvoter valve assemblies will not be performed. . To ensure design deficiencies are identified prior to plant installation, station procedures are being prepared to address inadequacies and strengthen FAT and SAT testing. Assessment of Safety Consequences For this event, High-Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) [SG], Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) [SN], and both trains of emergency AC power [EA, ES & EK] and Residual Heat Removal (RHR) [SO] systems were capable of performing their intended safety function. This event did not involve an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of any safety function described in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). This event posed no threat to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel and was therefore, not safety significant.  · , r "'l' NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

On August 21,2008, during performance of post maintenance testing of the DEH system following the planned replacement of Quadvoter "8," a Swagelok compression fitting failed. The. failure resulted in,an immediate drop in DEH system trip header pressure to below the RPS trip setpoint and a full scram of the reactor occurred. The root cause ofthe event was determined to be less than adequate installation and inspection/test requirements for the DEH compression fitting installation.
