EXPECTED I MONTH I DAY SUBMISSION I IDATE  YEAR  ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 2021 hours on August 27, 2011, a loss of shutdown cooling occurred due to a spurious undervoltage signal in one of two, in series, Electrical Protection Assembly (EPA) circuit breaker supplying the B train of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) power bus (RPS-B). Response to the spurious signal resulted in loss of power to RPS-B and associated actuations including isolation of the common shutdown cooling suction valves. The spurious signal originated in a logic board (GE Model 147D8652G007) associated with the EPA Breaker. Post event testing was unable to specifically identify the discrete component responsible for the failure. The root cause was that Energy Northwest was not proactive in replacing older, obsolete model boards (including the one that caused the event) with a new model recommended by the vendor. The faulty logic board and the other logic board in series for RPS-B were replaced with newer model boards. Further corrective actions will replace the remaining logic boards currently installed in the plant with the newer models. This event is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function, as well as an invalid actuation of containment isolation in multiple systems per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv).  26158 R5 NRC FORM '366~"'" U.s'.

NARRATIVE ~. , , " . ,.' Plant Conditions At the time of the event, the plant was in Mode 4 and 144 days ,,into refue,ling outage 20 (R-20). Shutdown cooling was provided by Loop B of the shutdown cooling (SDC) [BO] system. Reactor temperature was approximately 107 degrees Fahrenheit and RPV Level was in the 80 -100 inch range as indicated on shutdown range instrumentation. There was no equipment that was inoperable at the time of the event which contributed to the event. ' Event Description At 2021 hours on August 27, 2011, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) electrical power system bus "B" (RPS-B) [EC] was lost resulting in isolation of the active loop of shutdown cooling. Field survey, noted that both ElectricaJ Protection Assembly'(EPA),circui~breake~s [52] providing rlormal power supply for RPS-B were in the trip free position. The. upstream EPA preaker (J;l,PS-EPA<3,B) had undervoltage and power in Hghts illuminated.' No jndicating lights were present,on,the downstream breaker (RPS-EPA-3D). Immediat~ly following the event, the motor generator [MG] set supplying RPS-8 was noted to be running at 120 V with approximately 0 amps indicated current. Loss of RPS-8 results in isolation of primary containment isolation valves in multiple systems including closing the common shutdown cooling suction line rendering both shutdown cooling loops inoperable. Due, to ,both shutdo~1! cooling,Joops being inoperabl~, Technical Specification Action Statement 3.4.1 O.A was entered. All expected isolations were validated to have occurred due to the loss of RPS-8, including isolation of containment isolation valves in Groups 2, 4, 6, & 7 including the residual heat removal, reactor water cleanup [CE], reactor r~circulation,[AD], radiological drain [WK], 'contra! rod dr!ve,-[AA] and traversing incore probe [IG] systems. ImrY;lediate investigations confirmed that the loss of RPS-B was not caused by ongoing work, or by manual action directly on the Circuit breaker. This eyent'is reportable as an event that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to remove residual heat in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(8), as well as an invalid system actuation resulting in containment isolation in more than one system. A 10 CFR 50:72(b)(3)(v)(8) notification was made via Event Number 47209. ' Immediate Corrective Actions RPS-8 was repowered from the alternate power supply, the valve isolations were reset per plant procedures, and the technical specification action statement was exited. Following the event, a faulted logic board (GE Model 147D8652G007) [EC8D] was replaced with a vendor recommended newer replacement model. The logic board on the other in-line EPA circuit breaker for RPS-8 normal power supply was also replaced with a newer model board. Assessment of Safety Consequences The total time without shutdown cooling was 34 minutes and the reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature rose approximately 4 ,degrees Fahrenheit. The calculatedJime to reach, 200 degrees Fahrenheit was a roximatel 11 hours. An extended loss of shutdown coolin could have led to excessive fuel tem eratures 26158 R5 NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPOAT (LEA) , CONtIN(,U~tl()N SHEET.  1.

However, the actual significance was limited due to the short duration of the SDC outage and minimal temperature rise with substantial margin to 200 degrees. If the event had occurred earlier in the refueling outage shortly after shutdown, the significance would have been greater since the time to 200 degrees F is much shorter and could have resulted in an unintended and unplanned MODE change from MODE 4 to MODE 3. ' ¥.1, Had the logic card failure occurred in Modes 1 or 2, the same isolations and actuations would occur but would not be expected to result in a plant trip. The resulting isolations would require operator intervention to mitigate, ¥ but all response actions are covered by existing station procedures. Cause of Event The reason for the loss of RPS-B was due to a spu'rious unde'rvoltage trip signal from a logic board which is part of the EPA circuit breaker for RPS-B. The spus,ious yi1deivolt~g~ s,ig.nal was caused by a logic board fault" which has been identified aEj the direct cause of the 'event. Theroat cause is that Energy Northwest was not ' proactive in replacing older, obsolete., logic ~o~rdS:~it~l new m~d~ls recommended by the vendor. '" Similar Events No previous occurrences involvin'g a logic b0ard failure leading to an EPA breaker trip have been identified at Columbia. . " , '. Further Corrective Actions At the time of the event, a total of six of th~ G~,Model"'147D8652G007:logic boards'wereinstalled in the plant. Two were replaced as part of the immediate correCtive actions and the remaining fOu'rJwili be replaced as part of the corrective actions to prevent recurrence. Analysisuf the logic board by the vendor'was inconclusive.
