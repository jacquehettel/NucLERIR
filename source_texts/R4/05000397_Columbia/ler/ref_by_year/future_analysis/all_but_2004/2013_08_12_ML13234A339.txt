ABSTRACT (Utnlt to' 1400 spaces, I.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typ8Wrltt8n lines) On 611512013 at 1222 POT Columbia Generating Station was In a refueling outage In Mode 4 when vaRd Essential Safety Function (ESF) actuation signals of Division ,1 and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators were received due to a momentary loss of 115kV (1 of 2) offslte power sources. In addition valid actuation signals of DMsion 1 and 2 Essential Service Water System pumps were also received due to the start of DMslon 1and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators. The 4.16kV Division 1 and 2 critical switchgear buses were de-energlzed resulting In load shed of several systems and an Invalid actuation of containment Isolation valves for multiple systems. Power to the 4.16kV critical switchgear was automatically restored by the Emergency Diesel Generators. Plant systems which had been load shed were returned to operating status. The 4.16kV critical switchgear buses were subsequently realigned to an offslte power source. The momentary loss of the 115kV offsite power source was due to relays opening and reclosing to clear a fine fault associated with a range fire under the transmission line. 26168R5' NRC FORM 3IIA U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1()'2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LEA)

In preparation for heating up the reactor to support the Reactor Pressure Vessel hydro surveillance test. shutdown cooling had been secured and Residual Heat Removal (RHA) pump "C" had been started In Suppression Pool mixing. Due to recently performed testing on the 230kV Startup Transformer [XMFR}, the 4.16kV DivIsion 1 and 2 critical switChgear buses [eU) were powered from the 115kV offsite power source through the Backup Transformer [XFMR). EVENT DESCRIPTION On 611512013 at 1222 PDT Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) received valid Essential Safety Function (ESF) [JE] actuation signals of DivISion 1 and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators [DG] due to a momentary loss of the 115kV offslte power source and valid actuation signals of Division 1 and 2 Essential Service Water System [BI] pumps due to the start of OMsion 1 and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) .. Event NotifiCation #49120 and 10 CFR 6O.73(a)(2)(Iv)(A). On the loss of the 115kV offsite power source. the 4.16kV Division 1and 2 critical switchgear de-energized. The te~por.ry.Ioss of power to these critical switchgear buses resulted in the following: It 	Start of Division 1 and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators re-energizing the 4.16kV Division 1 and 2 critical 
.switchgear buses. The subsequ~nt start of OMsion 1 and 2 essential Service Water System pumps. 
е 	Closure of containment isolation valves In the Reactor Water Cleanup System [CEl, Equipment DraJn System and the. Floor. Drain System (WK]. This was an Invalid isolation and Is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) е. 	Fuel.Pool Cooling IDA) pumps tripped. е. 	Residual Heat Removal [SO) Pump "e" operating In Suppression Poot mixing mOde tripped and the system . depressurized. ._.

IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION 
Division 1 and 2 Emergency Diesel Generators automatically repowered the 4.16kV DMsion 1 and 2 critical switchgear 
buses in less than 15 seconds. 
Fuel Pool COOling pump liB" started automatically upon repowering the Division 2 critical switchgear bus. 
Division 1 and 2 Essentlat Service Water pumps started automatically due to the start of Division 1 and 2 Emergency 
Diesel Generators 
Actions were taken to restore the following systems to operating status:

An analysis of the response of plant equipment and protective systems concludes all safety related plant equipment and systems operated correctly for this condition. There were no safety system functional failures. There were no adverse effects on the health and safety of the public as a result of this event. SIMILAR EVENTS There has not been any occurrence of an event or concfltion In the past three years at Columbia Generating Station involving the actuation of a ESF due to a grid disturbance. ENERGY INDUSTRY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (Ens) INFORMATION CODES EllS codes 818 bracketed ( ] where applicable in the narrative. 26158 RS
