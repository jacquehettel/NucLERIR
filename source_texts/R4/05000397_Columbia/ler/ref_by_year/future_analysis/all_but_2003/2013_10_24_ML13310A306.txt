There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Event Description On August 25,2013 at 1818 hours, during a suddenly occurring thunderstorm, the secondary containment (NHJ pressure was not maintained greater than or equal to 0.25 inches of vacuum water gauge. This condition existed for a period of no greater than 160 seconds. Because Reactor Building [NG] pressure increased above -0.25 inches of water gauge (inwg) secondary containment was logged as inoperable in the surveillance log and Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 Action A was entered. Extent of Condition This condition of Reactor Building differential pressure momentarily rising above the prescribed limit Is specific to the Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Cooling (HVAC) [VA] and Standby Gas Treatment (SGT) [BH] systems, and their capability to establish and maintain secondary containment vacuum. No other systems are affected as a result of this condition. Immediate Corrective Action Operations took manual control of the Reactor Exhaust Air (REA) differential pressure (dP) controller [PDC] and quickly adjusted Reactor Building Exhaust Air flow to restore secondary containment pressure to less than -0.25 inwg. Later, after the storm had passed, operators placed the controller back In automatic. Cauae During normal plant operation, the non-safety related Reactor Building HVAC system maintains environmental conditions within the Reactor Building at a vacuum with respect to the outside. Various operational equipment manipulations and environmental conditions can result in the momentary Increase of differential pressure to above the Technical Specification maximum allowable pressure of -0.25 Inwg. Operational activities include the starting or stopping of SGT or Reactor Exhaust Air/Reactor Outside Air (REA/ROA) fans [FAN]. Environmental conditions which can cause a momentary increase In pressure include high, outside gusting winds. During normal operation with no extemal driving forces, the REA/ROA system does an excellent job of automatically maintaining a stabilized negative differential pressure in the Reactor BUilding at the controller setpolnt value of -0.6 inwg. However, the system (:entroller is not designed to respond to very quick changes in building differential pressure due to a nearly instantaneous shift in wind direction as was experienced during the thunderstorm. Operating Experience &: Prevloua Occurrencn A loss of the ability to maintain secondary containment below the required negative pressure has occurred at Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) twice In the past two years. On July 24. 2012, reported under LEA 2012-003-00, secondary containment was compromised due to an inadvertent trip of one set of the redundant Reactor Building HVAC fans, during ongoing maintenance on the SGr system. The second Instance occurred on December 10, 2011, reported under LER 2011-004-00. Secondary containment was declared Inoperable and the cause was determined to be Ice buildup and subsequent release on exterior equipment supplying the Reactor Building HVAC system. Each of these events have associated corrective actions and the causes are not applicable to the current cause of weather related pressure excursion, nor would corrective actions from these past events prevented occurrence of this event.

Technical Specification secondary containment pressure is reached. 
Assessment of Safety Consequences This event resulted in an unplanned entry into LeO 3.6.4.1.A. Secondary containment pressure was above -0.25 inwg for no more than 160 seconds. The peak pressure during this event was -0.03 Inwg. While the actual pressure was beyond the range allowed by Technical Specifications, the purpose of maintaining a slight VElcuum Is to assist in drawdown of secondary containment to support accident response of the safety related SOT systom. existing engineering analysis demonstrates that for this event, the drawdown credited in accident response could have been attained using either of the two available trains of the SGT system, thus there were no potential safety consequences. There was no actual safety consequence associated with this event since no event involving radiological hazards were experienced during the event. Energy Industry identification System (EllS) Information Energy Industry Identification System (EllS) Information codes from IEEE Standards 805-1984 and 803-1983 are represented in brackets as [XX] and [XXX] throughout the body of the narrative.
