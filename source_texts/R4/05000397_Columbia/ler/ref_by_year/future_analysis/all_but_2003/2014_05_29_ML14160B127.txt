Secondary containment pressure was not maintained greater than or equal to 0.25 inches of vacuum water gauge as required by Technical SpecIfication 3.6.4.1. This condition was experienced for a period of no greater than 160 seconds. Operations took manual control of the system and quickly adjusted Reactor Building Exhaust Air flow to restore secondary containment to less than ...().25 Inches water gauge. While Technical Specification limits were exceeded, the resulting pressure excursion was bounded by analytical results, and thus there were no safety consequences for this event. The cause for the event was determined to be failure of the Reactor Exhaust AirlReactor Outside Air system to automatically maintain a stabilized negative differential pressure in the Reactor Building at the controller setpolnt value of -0.6 Inches water gauge due to less than optimal control system tuning for the system. Corrective actions include determining, Implementing, and documenting the optimum control system tuning for the system, increasing margin by lowering differential pressure set point, and alerting operations before the Technical SpeCification limit for secondary containment pressure is reached.  26158 R6 NRC Form 366 (01-2014) .,

There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Event Deacrlptlon . . On August 25,2013 at 1818 hours, during a suddenly occumngthunderstonn, the secondary containment [NH] pressure was not maintained greater than or equal to 0.25 Inches of vacuum water gauge. This condition existed for a period of no greater. than 160 seconds. Because Reactor Building [NG) pressure Increased above ..Q.25 Inches of water gauge (Inwg) secondary containment was logged as inoperable In the survell!ance Iog~nd TeChnical Specification 3.6.4.1 Action A was entered. Extent of Condltlon This condition of Reactor Building differential pressure momentarily rising above the prescribed limit Is speclflc to the Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Cootlng (HVAC) (VA) and Standby Gas Treatment (SGT) IBH) systems, and their capability to estabJish and maintain secondary COnfalnment·vacuum. No other systems are affected as a result of this condition. Immediate Corrective ActIon Operations took manual control of the Reactor Exhaust AIr (REA) differential pressure (dP) controller [POe) and quickly adjusted Reactor Building Exhaust AIr flow to restore secondary containment pressure to less than -0.25 inwg. Later, after the storm had passed, operators placed the controller back in automatic. Cause During normal plant operation. the non-safety related Reactor Building HVAC system maintains environmental conditions within the Reactor Building at a vacuum with respect to the outside. The cause of secondary containment not being maintained greater than or equal to -0.25 Inwg was due to Improper tuning of the Reactor Building Outside Air (ROA) differential pressure controller. The transient response of the controller was not properly tuned to compensate for sudden pressure changes that are expected during operation of the pressure control system. Operating Experience & PrevIous Occurrence. A loss of the ability to maintain secondary containment below the required negative pressure has occurred at Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) twice In the past two years. On July 24, 2012, reported under LER 2012..Q03-OO, secondary containment was compromised due to an inadvertent trip of one set of the redundant Reactor Building HVAC fans, during ongoing maintenance on the SGT system. The second Instance occurred on December 10, 2011, reported under LER 2011..()()4..()(). Secondary containment was declared Inoperabte and the cause was determined to be ice buildup and subsequent release on exterior equipment supplying the Reactor Building HVAC system. Each of these events have associated corrective actions and the causes are not applicable to the current cause of weather related pressure excursion, nor would corrective actions from these past events prevented occurrence of this evant.  26158AR3 NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) 26158AR3 NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) NRC FORM 3I8A (114014) UCENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONnNUAnON SHEET U.s.

PAGE  05000 397  YEAR I SEQU~ IREV NUMBER NO.  3 OF 3  2013 •001 -01  NARRAnvE Further Corrective Actions The potential for these momentary pressure excursions will continue to occur as there has been no change In the deSign of the equipment. To minimiZe recurrence actions are being taken to update the current calibration procedures to reflect the optimum control system tuning for the REAfROA system, and increasing margin In secondary containment by lowering the differential pressure set point on the REA controllers. Columbia is also investigating methods to alert operations to a potential Issue with secondary containment before the Technical Spectflc:ation secondary containment pressure is reached. AsH••ment of Safety Consequences this event resulted In an unplanned entry Into LeO 3.6.4.1,A. Secondary containment pressure was above -0.25 inwg for no more than 160 seconds. The peak pressure during this event was -0.03 tnwg. While the actual pressure was beyond the range aHowed by Technical Specifications, the purpose of matntalnlng a slight vacuum Is to assist In drawdown of secondary containment to support accident response of the safety related SGT system. existing engineering analysis demonstrates that for this event, the drawdown credited In accident response could have been attained using either of the two available trains of the SGT system, thus there were no potential safety consequences. There was no actual safety consequence associated with this event since no event Involving radiological hazards were experienced during the event.
