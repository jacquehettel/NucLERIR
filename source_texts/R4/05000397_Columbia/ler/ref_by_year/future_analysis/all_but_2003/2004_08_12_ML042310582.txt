Columbia Generating Station  50-397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL NUMBER NUMBER  2003-003-00  NARRATIVE (If more space Is required, use additional copies ofNRC Form 366A) (17) DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 1822 on June 18, 2004, with Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) in mode 1, an Energy Northwest security x-ray machine operator detected a loaded handgun in the backpack of an Energy Northwest employee at Columbia's Protected Area (PA) access control point (ref: Event Report 40829). In response to this event, the individual's access to the PA was terminated and he left the owner controlled area after he was determined to be fit for duty. Local law enforcement (Benton County Sheriff) responded and took possession of the firearm. This event meets the criteria specified in 10 CFR ¤ 73, Appendix G, paragraph I(d), as this was an attempted introduction of contraband into Columbia's PA. This report is made pursuant to the requirement of 10 CFR ¤ 73.71(a)(4) for a 6O-day follow-up written report. Regulatory Guide 5.62, revision 1, section 3.2 instructs licensees to use NRC Form 366 when submitting these reports and describes the report content that is sufficient for NRC analysis and evaluation. Because this event does not involve a security system failure or a threat related incident, only items 1 through 14 in section 3.2 of the Regulatory Guide are germane to this issue and are addressed below: Date and Time of Event June 18,2003 at 1822 PDT.

PAGE(3) 30F4 Columbia Generating Station  50-397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL NUMBER NUMBER  2003-003"()()  Number and type of personnel involved One Energy Northwest employee and two Energy Northwest nuclear security officers were involved with this event. Method of discovery of incident The contraband was detected as the employee's backpack was processed through the x-ray machine in the protected area access control point. Procedural errors involved Although this action was a violation of an Energy Northwest policy. there were no procedural errors involved. Immediate actions taken in response to event Upon discovery of the contraband, the handgun was left in the x-ray machine while the employee was segregated and searched. A local law enforcement official was summoned to the scene and took possession of the firearm. The individual's access to the PA was terminated and he left the owner controlled area after he was determined to be fit for duty. Corrective actions taken or planned The fundamental cause is personnel error due to lack of attention to detail and lack of focus. Therefore, the corrective actions are centered on the individual involved. The individual's unescorted access to the PA has been restored based upon a favorable psychological evaluation and fitness for duty test. Local, State, or Federal law enforcement agencies contacted The local law enforcement agency (Benton County Sheriff) was contacted and took possession of the firearm. .
