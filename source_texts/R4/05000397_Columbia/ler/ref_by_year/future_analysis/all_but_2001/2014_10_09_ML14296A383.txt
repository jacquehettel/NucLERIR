The SR requires level in each spray pond to be verified to be greater than or equal to the minimum water level whereas procedures allowed for an arithmetic average of the two ponds to be taken when a single Service Water (SW) pump is in operation which creates a differential between the pond levels. The two spray ponds that make up Columbia's UHS are connected by a siphon line to allow water to be shared between the two ponds. Columbia's original TS did not specify that a minimum water level be checked in each pond and a procedural note was added to clarify compliance with the TS SR during single SW pump operation. When Columbia upgraded the TSs in 1997 the word 'each' was introduced to the TS. Corrective actions inclu.cIe a TS amendment submitted to the NRC on August 22, 2014.  26158 R6 NRC Fonn 368 (01-2014) NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3160-0104 EXPIRES: 01/3112017 (OH014) Eslimated burden per respI)/1S8 10 comply witll tI!is mandatOl)' collection request: 80 IIours.

Event Description 
On August 14. 2014 It was discovered that Columbia Generating Station's (Columbia) method of complying 
with Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.1.1 for Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) [as) 
spray pond level was Inadequate. 
Columbia's UHS consists of two concrete spray ponds. These spray ponds provide suction and discharge points for the redundant pumping and spray facilities of the Service Water (SW) [BI) system. SW loop A draws water from pond A and discharges through a spray ring into pond afor heat diSSipation. Similarly. SW loop a draws water from pond B and discharges through a spray ring into pond A. The water then retums to the initial pond through a siphon line. During operation with one SW pump running, a differential level develops between the ponds until flow through the siphon line equalizes with the running SW pump. The spray ponds remain with this differential level until the running pump is stopped and flow through the siphon line equalizes the spray pond levels. The ponds were licensed such that the combined water volume of the spray ponds is adequate to provide cooling water for 30 days of operation. assuming maximum evaporation and drift losses. Prior to implementation of improved TS (ITS) in June of 1997. there were separate TS for 5W and UH5. The UH5 T5 contained a SR to verify the UH8 water level was within its limit of 432 ft 9 inches mean sea level at a frequency of 24 hours. The operations surveillance procedure contained a note to take an arithmetic average of the spray pond levels if only one loop of SW was in operation. In March 1997, Columbia received license amendment 149 for ITS with a full Implementation date of June 30. 1997. The ITS combined-the 8W and UHS into one TS. The UHS water level surveillance requirement was changed to require the level in ~spray pond to be within the limit of 432 ft 9 inches. Due to the design of the spray ponds and 8W system. it is difficult to meet this requirement in each pond when only one SW pump is In operation. This discrepancy between the new T5 SR and how it is implemented in operations surveillance procedures was identified in 1997 and license document changes were initiated to change the TS SR and the T8 Bases to allow for an arithmetic average of the two ponds when a single pump is in operation. The T8 Bases change was processed; however the T8 SA change was not completed. The reason why the TS SR wasn't completed and submitted to the NRC for approval Is undocumented and unknown. Cau8e The cause of this event is that although it was recognized In 1997 that Columbia was out of verbatim compliance with TS SA 3.7.1.1. Columbia's licensing document change process in 1997 allowed for changes to the TS SA and T8 Bases to be processed separately. This allowed the TS Bases change to be implemented while the TS SR change was never completed or approved by the NRC. 26158A R3 NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) NRC FORM 3&6A (01-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION  1.

PAGE  05000 397  YEAR r SEQUENTIAl r REV NUMBER NO.  3 OF 3  2014 •004 -00  NARAAnVE Extent of Condition An extent of condition review determined that there have been multiple Instances when SW would need to be declared inoperable based on spray pond level as it is common practice to operate individual service water pumps based on plant needs. The 12 hour Limiting Conditions for Operation per TS 3.7.1 was exceeded on August 13, 2014 with additional occurrences since implementation of the ITS on June 30, 1997. Immediate Corrective Action Once it was discovered that the operations procedure was not compliant with the T8 SR all oncoming operations crews were briefed on the correct implementation of the TS SR. Guidance was also given to start both SW pumps if one is required to run. The operations surveillance procedure was also updated to remove the wording which allowed for the arithmetic average of the two ponds when a single pump is in operation. Columbia has submitted a TS change to the NRC to allow verification that the average water level in the UHS spray ponds is within the limit. The licensing change process is being updated to ensure processing of TS SR changes with TS Bases changes if related. Operating Experience & Previous Occurrencea No previous occurrences have been found to have the same cause of a license amendment change not processed. One event reported under LER-12-004-02 was a failure to enter a TS action statement due to conflicting information between the associated TS Bases and the surveiHance procedure. Corrective actions focused on operability determinations for equipment removed from service. It also included a focused self•assessment to review TS Bases and TS SRs. The self-assessment did not Identify the discrepancy described in this LER, and therefore a re-review of the wor1< performed by this individual Is being completed to ensure no other discrepancies between T8 SR, T8 Bases and Implementing procedures exist. Further Corrective Actlona A review of all TS Bases amendments was conducted to identify whether any other Licensing Document Changes were issued that introduced conflicts with the literal wording in the T8. Asaeaament of Sefety Consequencea There were no actual safety consequences associated with this event as during periods of SW single loop operation when one pond level was below TS minimum the actual inventory of the UHS was unaffected. The combined Inventory between the two ponds remained above the licensed amount required to provide adequate cooling for 30 days of operation.
