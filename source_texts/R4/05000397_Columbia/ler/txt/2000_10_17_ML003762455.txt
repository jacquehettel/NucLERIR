In response to increasing turbine back pressure, the operators began lowering reactor power. At 1509, with reactor power at 65 % and condenser vacuum at approximately 24 inches Hg, control room operators manually scrammed the reactor as directed by plant procedures. A turbine trip occurs automatically at a condenser vacuum of 20 inches Hg. _,.,_ -__ _ Immediate Corrective Action There were no immediate corrective actions. Root Cause An inspection of the "B" section of the main condenser [SG] revealed that one of two turbine "slop" drain lines routed through the condenser had broken off at its penetration connection on the north wall of the condenser. The "slop" drain lines are used to drain oil leakage from the turbine bearings andlor water leakage from turbine steam seal glands. The broken pipeline had effectively created two open pathways for air to enter the condenser (both sides of the pipe break). In addition, one U-bolt restraint on each drain line was found disconnected and not performing its function. Condenser sections "A" and "C" were also inspected for similar discrepancies, and the piping was found intact in both sections. However, a U-bolt restraint on one of the drain lines in condenser section "A" was also found disconnected. The cause of the pipe failure was metal fatigue. The pipe connection at the condenser north wall was a threaded coupling. Reduced pipe wall thickness, due to exposed pipe threads of the threaded pipe coupling created a stress riser. An excessive amount of stress was induced at the pipe connection due to a substantial length of unsupported pipe (not associated with the disconnected U-bolt restraint) and the turbulent environment in the condenser. The disconnected U-bolt restraint may have been a contributing factor, accelerating failure of the pipe. Further Corrective Action All of the "slop" drain threaded and seal welded connections to the north wall of the condenser (six total, two in each condenser section) were re-welded to strengthen the connection points. The disconnected U-bolt restraints were reconnected. Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no safety consequences associated with this event. The plant was manually scrammed to preclude an unnecessary challenge to the turbine and reactor protection system. Plant systems responded to the reactor scram as designed. This event did not result in a safety system functional failure pursuant to NEI 99-02, "Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline. " Similar Events There have been no previous similar events at WNP-2.
