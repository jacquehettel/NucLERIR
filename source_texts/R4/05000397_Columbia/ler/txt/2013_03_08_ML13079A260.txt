This planned inoperability of the SOC isolation valves was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SOC isolation valves and the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both divisions SOC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of SOC isolation valves were made inoperable without procedural guidance, this is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident.  26158 R5 --.

PAGE  Columbia Generating Station  05000397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL I NUMBER REV NO.  20F3  2012 -006 -01  NARRATIVE Plant Conditions: Event Description: On September 19, 2012, Energy Northwest (EN) identified that both divisions of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Cooling (SOC) [EllS: BO] Reactor Vessel isolation valves [EllS: ISV] were inappropriately made inoperable at the same time on multiple occasions in support of maintenance and surveillance testing during the 2011 refueling outage (R-20). This issue was identified and entered into the Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) corrective action program following review of the NRC Operating Experience Smart Sample (OpESS) 2012/02, Revision 1. All required Technical Specification (TS) Conditions for inoperable primary containment isolation valves were entered when the valves were made inoperable, and compliance with TS Actions was maintained. No operations with a potential to drain the reactor vessel were in progress. Columbia was in Mode 5 with the vessel flooded up. During R-20, EN implemented a plant modification to change the Group 1 containment isolation valves [EllS: ISV] isolation signal of reactor water level from level 2 to level 1. The NRC granted permission for this change to TS in a letter dated August 18, 2009 (TAC NO. M09598). This planned inoperability of the SOC isolation valves, in support of the maintenance and surveillance activities associated with the modification to change the isolation signal from level 2 to level 1, was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SOC-BVPASS. SOP-RHR-SOC-BVPASS contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SOC isolation valves and the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SOC-BVPASS did not contain guidance to allow both divisions of SOC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of the SOC isolation valves were made inoperable and the approved procedure did not provide specific guidance for removal of both divisions at the same time, this is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and 50.73(a)(2)(v)(O). Extent of Condition: An extent of condition review was performed. In the last three years, both divisions of RHR SOC isolation valves being inoperable at the same time was during R-20. There were multiple instances in which this occurred in R-20. A similar issue occurs during transfer of a Reactor Protection System bus. Both divisions of containment isolations valves for RHR SOC and Reactor Water Cleanup [EllS: CE] are made inoperable. Immediate Corrective Action: No immediate corrective action was required. Cause: Apparent Cause: The operating crews inappropriately de-energized both divisions of RHR SOC isolation valves in the effort to minimize the potential for the loss of shutdown cooling without adequate procedural guidance.  26158 R5 -....

PAGE  Columbia Generating Station  05000397  YEAR I SEQUENTIAL I REV NUMBER NO.  30F3  2012 -006 -01  NARRATIVE Operating Experience & Previous Occurrences: This had not previously occurred at Columbia. A similar issue was discussed in Operating Experience Smart Sample (OpESS) 2012/02, Revision 1. Further Corrective Actions: Training for Licensed Operators will be conducted on the requirement of TS bases 3.0.2 for intentionally entering TS Actions as identified by the Performance Analysis. Selected plant procedures will be revised to discuss "Operational Convenience". Assessment of Safety Consequences: Each occurrence took place when the plant was in Mode 5 with the reactor vessel in a flooded condition. No operations with a potential to drain the vessel were in progress. The inoperability of the RHR SOC isolation valves was not due to equipment failure. If a loss of reactor level was detected, the isolation valves could be quickly restored to an operable condition. All required TS conditions were entered. Compliance with all TS actions was maintained. There was no significant impact on safety consequences.
