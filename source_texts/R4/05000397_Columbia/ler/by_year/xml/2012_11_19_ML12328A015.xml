This planned inoperability of the SDC isolation valves was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SDC isolation valves and the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both divisions SDC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of SDC isolation valves were made inoperable without procedural guidance, this is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident. An evaluation in accordance with the corrective action program is currently in progress. A supplemental report will be submitted to add additional details concerning the evaluation's conclusions and corrective actions. </Figure><P>26158 R5 26158 R5 </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

This issue was identified and entered into the Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) corrective action program following review of the NRC Operating Experience Smart Sample (OpESS) 2012/02, Revision 1. All required technical specification conditions for inoperable primary containment isolation valves were entered when the valves were made inoperable, and compliance with actions was maintained. No operations with a potential to drain the reactor vessel were in progress. Columbia was in Mode 5 with the vessel flooded up. Ouring R-20, EN implemented a plant modification to change the Group 1 isolation valves reactor water level signal from level 2 to level 1. The NRC granted permission for this change to technical specifications (TS) in a letter dated August 18, 2009 (TAC NO. M09598). This planned inoperability of the SOC isolation valves, in support of the maintenance and surveillance activities associated with the modification to change the isolation Signal from level 2 to level 1, was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SOC-BYPASS. SOP-RHRSOC-BYPASS contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SOC isolation valves and the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SOC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both divisions of SOC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of the SOC isolation valves were made inoperable and the approved procedure did not provide specific guidance for removal of both divisions at the same time, this is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and 50.73(a)(2)(v)(O). Extent of Condition: An extent of condition review was performed. The only instances of both divisions of RHR SOC isolation valves being inoperable at the same time was during R-20. There were multiple instances in which this occurred in R-20. Immediate Corrective Action: No immediate corrective action was required. Cause: The correction action process to determine a cause is still in progress. This information will be provided in the supplemental report. Operating Experience &amp; Previous Occurrences: This had not previously occurred at Columbia. </TH></TR></Table><P>... .I' '&quot; </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

This information will be provided in the supplemental report. Assessment of Safety Consequences: Each occurrence took place when the plant was in Mode 5 with the reactor vessel in a flooded condition. No operations with a potential to drain the vessel were in progress. The inoperability of the RHR SDC isolation valves was not due to equipment failure. If a loss of reactor level was detected, the isolation valves could be quickly restored to an operable condition. All required TS conditions were entered. Compliance with all TS actions was maintained. There was no significant impact on safety consequences.
