PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -007 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design.  The pressurizer and its associated heaters were replaced in the fall of 2006 as part of a plant upgrade project.  The pressurizer is designed with 36 pressurizer heaters.  The heaters are 480 VAC immersion heaters with an output of approximately 25 (23.6) kilowatts each.  Each heater is 1.252 inches in diameter, approximately 5 feet long, and protrudes vertically into the pressurizer through sleeves welded in the bottom head of the pressurizer.  The heaters and sheaths were manufactured by Watlow Electric Manufacturing. EVENT DESCRIPTION During inspections to determine the physical integrity of a failed pressurizer heater it was determined that the heater sheath (number 26) was cracked.  Due to the location of the pressurizer heater crack, this is considered a degradation of the RCS Barrier.  The initial visual inspection of heater 26 in November 2011 did not identify the cracking.  It appears that the crack expanded during the intervening period.  During efforts to remove the heater, a crack was observed on May 19, 2012.  The crack is above and below the heater support plate. The crack is an axial crack showing some branching.  The crack is about an inch above and inch below the heater support plate.  These inspections were being performed as a result of operating experience.  On May 23, 2012, it was determined that the pressurizer sheath was part of the reactor coolant system boundary.  However, there were no indications of any external RCS leakage. At 1854 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on May 23, 2012, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations office (HOO), under 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(ii)(a).  This report is being made per 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A). This LER reports a condition that was documented in the FCS corrective action program on several occasions. A ground on a pressurizer heater on May 9, 2010, was only reviewed with respect to the Technical Specification requirements for available pressurizer heaters.  When the potential challenge to the reactor coolant boundary due to a failed pressurizer heater was identified on August 5, 2011, the Operations review focused on the current operating conditions, noting that the condition would need to be resolved prior to start up.  The station paradigm inappropriately concluded that reportability could be evaluated at a later date since current operating conditions were not challenged, and that the 60-day reporting window commenced when the event was determined to be reportable.  In addition, FCS resources were focused on flood response and mitigation due to the extensive flooding that occurred along the Missouri River beginning in June 2011.  FCS had declared an Unusual Event on June 6, 2011, due to rising river level and river projections, and resources were focused on flood response and asset protection.  This condition was initially reported in Event Notification (EN) 47953 on May 23, 2012, at 1854 CDT.  FCS has been systematically addressing issues that have been identified since June 2011, in response to the flooding conditions, switchgear fire, and increased oversight.  This LER is being submitted beyond the 60-day regulatory reporting requirement due to non-conservative decisions with respect to procedural and regulatory reportability requirements and resource constraints caused by the operating challenges which began in June 2011. CONCLUSION A root cause analysis is in progress.  The conclusions of the analysis will be presented in a supplement to this LER. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12205A188_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2012 -007 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Actions to Prevent Recurrence The cracked heater has been removed and replaced.  The other heater sheaths have been very rigorously inspected to ensure any cracks would be identified.  None of the other heater sheaths had indications of cracking. Additional actions will be tracked in the stations corrective action system. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE While the heater sheath crack caused the electrical failure of the pressurizer heater, the heater design includes a secondary seal (not the RCS pressure boundary) that prevented any leakage from the reactor coolant system. This integral safety function operated as anticipated and designed.  FCS performed a bare metal inspection of the pressurizer bottom head and confirmed that there were no indications of any external RCS leakage from any of the heaters or their penetrations.  Therefore this event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS The station has not had any previous cracking of pressurizer heater sheaths. </Figure></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
