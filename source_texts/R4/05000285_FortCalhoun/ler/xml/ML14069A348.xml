design. 
</P><P>Four raw water pumps are installed in the intake structure pump house to provide screened river 
water to the component cooling heat exchangers. 
</P><P>Protection for the raw water pumps and their drives against floods is provided at three elevations. </P><P>The pumps are permanently protected against any water level up to elevation 1 ,007.5 feet by the </P><P>Class I concrete substructure of the intake building. Protection against the 1 ,009.5-foot and </P><P>1 ,014-foot floods is provided by gasketed steel closures at exterior doorway openings and the </P><P>screen wash discharge trough. The water level inside the intake cells can be controlled by pre</P><P>positioning the exterior sluice gates (Le., before floodwater reaches the elevation that prevents </P><P>access to the sluice gate manual actuators) to severely restrict the inflow into the cells. Intake </P><P>cell level is then controlled by varying the raw water pump(s) output to remove the inlet flow. </P><P>Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Figure 9.8-1 is provided below for reference. </P><P>Traveling Screen Sluice Gate Operators </P></Sect><Sect><H2>h~---</H2><P>EL.1814.5 TOP OF PERIMETER WIoLL KETEO STEEL CLOSURE PANELS</P><P>LT TO ALL EXTERIOR OOORWAY</P><P>R</P><P>NIHGS. </P><P>EL.1&quot;'.!!

Exceptions to these requirements shall be stated in the individual specifications. </P><P>EVENT DESCRIPTION </P><P>At approximately 2230 Central Standard Time (CST), on January 8,2014, CW-14C, TRAVELING SCREEN SLUICE GATE, motor operator shaft was found damaged (bent) by Operations personnel. At 2330 CST a large block of ice buildup was observed on top of the sluice gate caused by a pinhole leak in the backwash piping located directly above the CW-14C gate. At 0250 CST, January 9,2014, Operations unsuccessfully attempted manual closing of CW-14C. At 0315 CST the station entered TS 2.0.1 (1) due to all RW pumps being declared inoperable. At 0518 CST the station commenced a reactor shutdown. At 0542 CST the NRC Headquarter Operations Office (HOO) was notified of the inoperability of the RW pumps (10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(8) and TS required shutdown 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) (Event Notification (EN) 49703 and 49704). At 0900 CST the station completed the reactor shutdown. This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A), 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8) and10 CFR 50.72(a)(2)(v)(8). The issue was entered into the corrective action system as condition report (CR) 2014-00329. </P><P>CW-14C was manually lowered and then verified closed by divers. The flooding strategy for the Intake Structure was met at 0350 CST on January 10, 2014. Raw water Pumps AC-10A, AC-108, AC-10C and AC-10D were declared operable and TS 2.0.1(1) was exited. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) U_S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </P><P>(10-2010) </P><P>1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE </P><P>I SEQUENTIAL I REVYEAR </P><P>NUMBER NO. Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 4 OF 2014 -001 -o </P><P>NARRATIVE </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>Engineering Analysis (EA) 12-018 upgraded the sluice gates to limited-critical quality element (L</P><P>CQE). The CW-14 sluice gates had not been previously credited as safe shutdown equipment. </P><P>Even though the CW-14 sluice gates became credited as safe shutdown equipment, FCS did not </P><P>treat the sluice gates any different than before the reclassification. Consequently, the valves' motor </P><P>operators (MOVs) were never entered into the MOV program, additional analyses and preventative </P><P>maintenance (PM) items were not implemented. </P><P>CW-14C torque switch as found setting was different than the last time the switch was adjusted. In April, 2013, the torque switch for CW-14C was set to increment 2.5. The as found value after the event initiating this report was 3.75. Additionally, the torque switch was found pre loaded in the open direction -meaning that it would take more torque applied to the valve before the valve would trip on torque in the shut direction. The torque switch was preloaded 2 increments bringing the total value of the torque setting to 5.75, placing the MOV in a condition where it would cause significant damage to the MOV had the stem not bent. </P><P>Additionally, the spring pack -the part of the MOV which translates motor torque to the torque limiter switch was unable to complete its function due to the amount of grease that had seeped into the spring plate section. The grease would not allow the spring pack to compress thereby not translating motor torque to the torque limiter switch. The combined effect as described above in addition to the extreme cold temperatures on the intake structure veranda was that the MOV would not have tripped on over-torque before failure of the MOV. </P><P>The Root Cause was determined to be that CW-14C MOV torque setting was at a value that allowed the stem to be bent. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS </P><P>Immediate Corrective Actions: </P><P>CW-14C was lowered and then verified closed by divers. The flooding strategy for the Intake </P><P>Structure was met at 0350 CST on January 10, 2014. Raw water Pumps AC-10A, AC-10B, AC</P><P>10C and AC-10D were declared operable and TS 2.0.1(1) was exited. </P><P>The covers were opened for CW-14 A, CW-14B, and CW-14F to see if the condition existed 
with other sluice gates with known bent stem problems (CW-14A1B) and no know history of bent 
stems (CW-14F). None of the other MOVs inspected had significant preloading. 
</P><P>Long Term Corrective Actions </P><P>All CW-14 and CW-15 MOVs will be added to the MOV program having similar treatment to a 
GL 89-10 MOVs.
