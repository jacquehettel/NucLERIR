PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -017 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND System Description HCV-238 is the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Loop 1A Charging Line Stop Valve.  This valve performs an active safety function in the open and closed positions and fails open on loss of air.  An air accumulator is provided to ensure that this valve can perform its closed safety function on loss of air for 25 hours. Failure of the nitrile elastomers during a design basis accident (DBA) would not affect the safety related function of this valve, but would hinder the ability to prevent excessive RCS depressurization. HCV-239 is the RCS Loop 2A Charging Line Stop Valve. This valve performs an active safety function in both the open and closed positions and fails open on loss of air.  An air accumulator is provided to ensure that this valve can perform its closed safety function on loss of air for 25 hours.  Failure of the nitrile elastomers during a DBA would hinder the valve’s ability to perform a safety related function. HCV-240 is the Pressurizer, RC-4, Auxiliary Spray Inlet Valve.  This valve performs an active safety function in both the open and closed positions and fails closed on loss of air.  An air accumulator is provided to ensure that this valve can perform its open safety function on loss of air for 25 hours.  Failure of the nitrile elastomers during a DBA would hinder the valve’s ability to perform a safety related function. EVENT DESCRIPTION While performing an extent of condition review of Condition Report (CR) 2012-05509, which questioned the adequacy of air operated equipment inside containment to withstand containment main steam line break (MSLB) and loss of coolant accident (LOCA) temperatures, it was discovered that valves HCV-238, HCV-239, and HCV-240 have nitrile based elastomers for the air filter regulator and actuator that may not be able to withstand Containment MSLB and LOCA temperatures.  The design temperature limit for the nitrile elastomers used in the valves is 180°F which is acceptable for the normal operating conditions inside Containment of 120°F.  However, during MSLB and LOCA accident the temperature inside Containment is analyzed to reach 370°F. Since these valves have both open and close functions failure of the nitrile based elastomers could prevent the valves from fulfilling their intended safety function. This condition is being submitted pursuant to: 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
