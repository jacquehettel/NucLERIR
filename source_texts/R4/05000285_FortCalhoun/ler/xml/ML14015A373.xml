These impacts involved increased loads on supports in the piping subsystem MS-4099 (main steam supply to FW-10), high energy line cracking (HELC) related to auxiliary steam in various rooms in the power block, the assumptions made regarding diesel generator operability during a HELB, and the quality of the steam to FW-10, the steam-driven auxiliary feedwater pump. </P><P>It was previously determined and reported that FCS did not fully implement and/or maintain the Electrical Equipment Qualification (EEQ) program to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.49.

Subsequently on November 5, 11, 16, and 20, additional impacts were also identified. These impacts involved increased loads on supports in the piping subsystem MS-4099 (main steam supply to FW-10, the steam-driven auxiliary feedwater pump), high energy ling cracking (HELC) related to auxiliary steam in various rooms in the power block, the assumptions made regarding diesel generator operability during a HELB, and the quality of the steam to FW-10. </P><P>At approximately 1938 Eastern Daylight Time (EST) on October 18, 2013, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations Office, under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), Degraded Condition, reporting the initial HELB impact from the LDHX piping. </P><P>These events are being submitted as a separate LER due to being discovered in excess of 60 days from LER 2013-011. This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii) any event or condition that resulted in: (B) the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety; 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (B) remove residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii) any event where a single cause or condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to: (B) remove residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A) any event or condition that as a result of a single cause could have prevented the fuHillment of a safety function for two or more trains or channels in different systems that are needed to: (2) remove residual heat; (3) control the release of radioactive material; and (4) mitigate the consequences of an accident. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>It was previously determined and reported in OPPD LERs 2012-017 and 2013-011 that FCS did not fully implement and/or maintain the electrical equipment qualification (EEQ) program to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.49. As a consequence, the equipment included in the EEQ program, the systems included in the HELB analysis and the environmental conditions used by the EEQ program have not been maintained current or in an auditable manner. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
