The original condition was identified on October 18, 2012. Although FCV-1369 is a fail-open valve, a closure due to a failure of a non-critical quality element (CaE) component coincident with a demand closure of HCV-1107B, Steam Generator RC-2A Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve and HVC-1108B, Steam Generator RC-2B Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve, could result in damage to FW-10 due to cavitation. FW-10 is the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump. The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. </P><P>The current review determined that the components in question, although procured as CaE, had not been maintained as CaE. Additionally, the control loop is classified as non-CaE; therefore, the associated cables were not routed in safety related cable trays. The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. Although the condition only applies to the turbine-driven AFW pump (FW-10), during the last operating cycle the motor-driven AFW pump (FW-6) was taken out of service for testing. </P><P>This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS </P><P>Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. </P><P>SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE </P><P>Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
