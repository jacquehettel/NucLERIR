The plant has three 480V “island” buses.  The island buses are fed from one side or the other of the main 480V buses. EVENT DESCRIPTION On June 7, 2011, at approximately 0930 CDT, a failure of a safety related 480 volt (V) AC load center supply breaker occurred (Bus 1B4A).  FCS was operating in Mode 5 at about 82 degrees Fahrenheit with the plant fully depressurized. FCS was in an emergency classification of a Notification of Unusual Event (NOUE) due to high Missouri river level (NOUE declared June 6, 2011). At 0930, the control room received multiple alarms that were indicative of a fire in the west electrical switchgear room.  The Halon system that protects the switchgear rooms discharged. The fire brigade responded and found a room filled with smoke, but no active fire.  The fire brigade confirmed that there was no active fire in the switchgear room.  At about 0930 CDT, while de-energizing electrical buses to aid in damage mitigation and assessment, both trains of spent fuel pool cooling were de-energized.  Spent fuel pool temperature increased 3 degrees Fahrenheit.  At 0940 CDT, an Alert was declared for a fire affecting the operability of plant safety systems required to establish or maintain safe shutdown.  During the course of the event a local offsite fire department responded to assist.  At 1147 CDT, on June 7, 2011, power was restored to one train of spent fuel cooling. At 1313 CDT on June 7, 2011, FCS exited the Alert.  Plant shutdown cooling remained in-service during the event. The circuit breaker that was damaged was the supply breaker to Bus 1B4A. At 1021 CDT, the NRC Headquarters Operations Office (HOO) was notified per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i).  This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(x). CONCLUSION A root cause analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be reported in a revision to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The affected bus was de-energized and the Halon system extinguished the fire.  The Halon system was recharged and restored to service. The station will be replacing the affected bus (1B4A), which contains two 480V supply circuit breakers, 1B4A and BT-1B4A (supply breaker to the associated “island” bus). </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The circuit breakers in bus 1B4A were not tested as they are to be replaced.  The tested 480V supply breakers and bus tie breakers passed their inspections and testing. The station has completed inspections and testing of the 480V buses, as part of an extent of condition review. An indication of potential overheating in a bus connection was repaired.  Additional corrective actions for the root cause and extent of condition will be identified by the stations corrective action system. These actions will be documented in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The safety significance of the event will be provided in a revision to this LER. PREVIOUS EVENTS None </TH></TR></Table></TaggedPDF-doc>
