EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 24, 2014, during a review of previous conditions affecting equipment qualification it was determined that a condition repaired in 2012 and 2013 may need additional review for reporting. During a comparison of vendor manual requirements in applicable plant procedures associated with the Fort Calhoun recovery efforts on May 3, 2012, it was identified that the environmental qualification of Namco EA 180 series limit switches were not being properly maintained per vendor requirements in that revision 6 of maintenance procedure EM-RR-VX-0410, &quot;Maintenance of Limit Switch Type EA-180 to Maintain EEQ Qualification,&quot; did not require the replacement of the limit switch top cover gasket and screw assemblies and torqueing of the top cover screws to 20 to 25 inch-pounds each time the top cover was removed. Instead, EM-RR-VX-0410 called for torqueing the limit switch top cover screws to 19 to 21 inch-pounds and did not call for the replacement of the limit switch top cover gasket and screw assemblies each time the top cover was removed. The following components are within the scope of this issue: FCV-326 -Shutdown Cooling Heat Exchanger Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) bypass flow control valve HCV-1041A11042A -Main Steam Isolation Valves HCV-1107/1108A1B -Steam Generator Auxiliary Feedwater inlet valves HCV-1387/1388 -Steam Generator Blowdown Isolation Valves HCV-238/239 -Reactor Coolant System Charging Line stop valves HCV-240 -Pressurizer Spray inlet valve HCV-241 -Reactor Coolant Pumps Controlled Bleed-Off Inboard isolation valve HCV-2504/2506/2507 AlB -Steam Generator Sample Line inboard and outboard isolation valves HCV-2603A1B -Safety Injection (SI) Tank SI-6A1D supply isolation valves HCV-2604A1B -Reactor Coolant Drain Tank (RCDT) supply isolation valves HCV-2898/2899A1B -Control Room Ventilation Unit Component Cooling Water (CCW) inlet/outlet valves HCV-2907/2908/2917/2918/2927/2928 -High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) suction/discharge valves HCV-2937/2938/2947/2948 -Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) suction/discharge valves HCV-2957/2958/2967/2968/2977/2978 -Containment Spray (CS) suction/discharge Valves HCV-2916/2936/2956/2976 -SI Tank SI-6A1D fill/drain valves HCV-2987 -HPSI Alternate Header isolation valve HCV-304/305/306/307 -HPSI Header cross connect and isolation valves HCV-335 -Shutdown Cooling Heat Exchanger inlet header isolation valve HCV-425A1425C -SI Leakage Cooler combined CCW inlet/outlet header inboard isolation valve HCV-438A1438C -Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) lube oil and seal coolers CCW inlet/outlet inboard isolation valve </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A 02·2014) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION ........

A verbal report was not required as this event is of a historical nature. CONCLUSION A cause evaluation was completed and determined that technical information from the vendor manual for maintaining environmental qualification of the Namco EA 180 series limit switches was not captured in procedure EM-RR-VX-0410. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedure EM-RR-VX-0410 was revised to include vendor information for maintaining environmental qualification of the Namco EA 180 limit switches. The limit switch top cover gasket and screw assemblies for affected environmentally qualified Namco EA 180 series limit switches installed in the plant have been replaced and the associated top cover screws properly torqued to 20 to 25 inch-pounds. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE With the exceptions noted below, the affected limit switches provide component position indication only; they do not impact the automatic operation of the affected safety systems. In some accidents, the operators would use supplemental indication to validate proper operation of safety system function . Validation of proper system operation is a normal part of the station emergency and abnormal operating procedures and operator training. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>~RC FORM 366A 02-2014) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION ..............~~ f ? \ j ~......
