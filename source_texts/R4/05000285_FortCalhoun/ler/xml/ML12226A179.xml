It was determined that pressure switches that provide safety related signals for high containment pressure to the reactor protection system (RPS) and engineered safeguards actuation circuitry may be similarly affected at FCS. The impact of the potential drift was evaluated and it was determined that neither RPS nor the engineered safeguard circuitry may actuate at the required containment pressure of 5 psig. An evaluation determined that the actuation may not occur until slightly higher than the required pressure. Other systems are currently being evaluated for this condition. A cause analysis was completed. However, internal reviews have identified that additional investigation is required to sufficiently characterize this issue. The results of the revised cause analysis and corrective actions will be published in a supplement to this report. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12226A179_img_0.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.

PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 2 2012 -004 -1 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET EVENT DESCRIPTION While investigating operating experience from another station it was determined that Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is subject to similar conditions.  The operating experience involved setpoint drift of safety-related pressure switches beyond what had been accounted for in the station’s safety analyses.  Engineering performed an equipment database search to determine where the switches in question were installed at FCS.  Several switches that input into specific Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Engineered Safeguards Actuation Circuitry (ESF) loops were in the affected population.  Specifically these pressure switches provide safety-related signals for high containment pressure to the RPS and ESF. The impact of the potential drift was evaluated and it was determined that neither RPS nor the engineered safeguard circuitry may actuate at the required containment pressure of 5 psig.  A preliminary evaluation determined that the actuation may occur at a slightly higher value than the required pressure.  Other systems are currently being evaluated for the condition. On May 2, 2012, an eight (8)-hour report was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) at 1802 CDT (Event Number (EN) 47892) as an unanalyzed condition. This LER is amending the reporting criteria for this issue as reported in LER 2012-004-0.   This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A,B,C,D). CONCLUSION The cause analysis is being revised and the results will be provided in a supplement to this report. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective actions will be determined following the revision of the cause analysis. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The cause analysis is being revised.  The safety significance of this event will be provided in a supplement to this LER following completion of the analysis. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS No events of a similar nature have been identified. </Figure></TaggedPDF-doc>
