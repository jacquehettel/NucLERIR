PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -015 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION FCS has been conducting a comprehensive re-evaluation of potential high energy line breaks and radiological impacts outside containment.  On September 16, 2011, while reviewing a draft of the Master List Reconstitution for Electrical Equipment Qualification, FCS Engineering Department personnel identified that some of the listed components may not be qualified for the environments where they are located. Of the 29 items listed, seven were identified that may exhibit spurious operation when exposed to a post-accident harsh environment.  Those items are: PCS-2937, Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) Pump Suction Valve SI-1B Pressure Control Switch PCS-2947, LPSI Pump Suction Valve SI-1A Pressure Control Switch Failure of these pressure switches in a post-accident harsh environment may result in spurious operation of the low pressure safety injection (LPSI) suction valves. A spurious closure of these valves will result in a loss of LPSI pump suction from the Safety Injection Refueling Water tank (SIRWT) and a spurious opening with the SIRWT below the minimum level may result in air intrusion into the pump. VA-40A-M, Contaminated Area Exhaust Unit Fan A Motor VA-40B-M, Contaminated Area Exhaust Unit Fan B Motor VA-40C-M, Contaminated Area Exhaust Unit Fan C Motor These fans are required to provide cooling to the safety injection (SI) pump rooms in a post-accident scenario.  All trains of SI will become inoperable due to room heat-up after a loss of these fans. HCZ-1105, Feedwater Bypass Valve Positioner HCZ-1106, Feedwater Bypass Valve Positioner The failure of the positioners will not affect the ability of the feedwater bypass valves HCV-1105 and HCV-1106 to open and provide auxiliary feedwater as this function can be accomplished by operation of the hand controller.  However, the hand controller does not have the ability to close the valves. Therefore, the safety function of the valves closing on a Steam Generator Isolation Signal will be lost. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12244A053_img_2.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2012 -015 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET This condition is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident, The condition described in this LER was identified in September 2011, but not promptly investigated as a reportable condition.  The station paradigm inappropriately concluded that reportability could be evaluated at a later date since current operating conditions were not challenged, and that the 60-day reporting window commenced when the event was determined to be reportable.  FCS has been systematically addressing issues that have been identified since June 2011, in response to the flooding conditions, switchgear fire, and increased oversight.  This LER is being submitted beyond the 60-day regulatory reporting requirement due to non-conservative decisions with respect to procedural and regulatory reportability requirements and resource constraints caused by the operating challenges which began in June 2011. CONCLUSION A cause analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A cause analysis is in progress.  The corrective actions will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE A cause analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS A cause analysis is in progress. Previous Events will be determined from the results of the cause analysis. </Figure></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
