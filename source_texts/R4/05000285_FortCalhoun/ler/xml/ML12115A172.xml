However, procedure changes made in 1990 removed the test of the automatic start of the fuel oil transfer pumps on low level in the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) day tank.  Without full testing of the automatic functions of the fuel oil transfer pumps, they cannot be considered operable.  Consequently, the EDGs cannot be considered operable because all auxiliary equipment to support operability has not demonstrated that it is fully capable of performing its safety function.  There is reasonable assurance that the EDGs and fuel transfer pumps would function as required as the low level switches are calibrated on a refueling frequency and have functioned correctly during extended EDG surveillances.

However, procedure changes made in 1990 removed the test of the automatic start of the fuel oil transfer pumps on low level in the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) day tank. Without full testing of the automatic functions of the fuel oil transfer pumps, they cannot be considered operable.  Consequently, the EDGs cannot be considered operable because all auxiliary equipment to support operability has not demonstrated that it is fully capable of performing its safety function.   “A system, subsystem, train, component or device shall be OPERABLE or have OPERABILITY when it is capable of performing its specified safety function(s) and when all necessary attendant instrumentation, controls, normal or emergency electrical power sources, cooling and seal water, lubrication, and other auxiliary equipment that are required for the system, subsystem, train, component or device to perform its specified safety function(s) are also capable of performing their related support function(s).” Monthly fuel oil transfer pump testing is required by TS 3.7(1) e. and Table 3-2, Item 12. EVENT DESCRIPTION During a Quality Assurance (QA) review of surveillance procedures, an apparent failure to perform surveillance testing of the full automatic functions of the EDG fuel oil transfer pumps was identified.  Technical Specifications require monthly testing of the fuel oil transfer pumps.  However, procedure changes made in 1990 removed the test of the automatic start of the fuel oil transfer pumps on low level in the EDG day tank.  Without full testing of the automatic functions of the fuel oil transfer pumps, they cannot be considered operable.  Consequently, the EDGs cannot be considered operable because all auxiliary equipment to support operability has not demonstrated that it is fully capable of performing its safety function.  CONCLUSION A cause determination is in progress.  The results of the evaluation will be published in a revision to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective actions have been developed to revise the EDG surveillance tests to include fuel oil transfer pump surveillance testing. Additional corrective actions may be developed based on the conclusions of the cause analysis. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12115A172_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2012 -005 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Failure to fully test the automatic functions of the fuel oil transfer pumps renders the pumps inoperable.  Therefore, consistent with the definition of OPERABLE, the EDGs cannot be considered operable as they rely upon the fuel oil transfer pumps to ensure an adequate fuel supply when the EDGs are performing their safety function. The EDGs have been technically inoperable in excess of TS allowed times. However, there is reasonable assurance that the EDGs and fuel transfer pumps would function as required as the low level switches are calibrated on a refueling frequency and have functioned correctly during extended EDG surveillances. FCS TS do not contain electrical system requirements for shutdown conditions.  The inoperability of the EDGs in the current operating MODE does not violate TS.  The EDGs will be fully operable prior to plant restart and modes of applicability. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS Previous events will be identified by the cause analysis and included in the supplement to this LER. </Figure><Table><TR><TD>FORT CALHOUN STATION </TD><TD/><TD/><TD>NOD-QP-9.2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>QUALITY PROCEDURE FORM </TD><TD/><TD>R0 </TD></TR><TR><TD/><TD>LICENSING CORRESPONDENCE REVIEW FORM </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD/><TD/><TD>LIC-12-0044 </TD><TD/></TR></Table><P>Date Issued:  4/19/12 Requested Return Date:____4/20/12______
