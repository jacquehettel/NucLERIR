   <abstract>An Engineering review identified that a potential issue existed concerning
               Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) capability to power required loads in certain loss
               of offsite power (LOOP) scenarios, specifically those scenarios during which a Loss
               of Coolant Accident (LOCA) or Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) does not occur. In a LOOP
               without a concurrent accident signal, the 480 V load shed that would be initiated as
               a direct result of the accident signal does not occur. Therefore, the electrical load
               that the EDGs must pick up when the EDG output breaker automatically closes could be
               significantly higher than the dead load that exists in an accident scenario. A review
               of design basis calculations and engineering analyses has identified several
               evaluations that consider the EDG dead load during accidents. However, no documents
               evaluating EDG dead loads in non-accident conditions were found. If one EDG were
               inoperable due to maintenance or other activities and the electrical distribution
               system loading conditions were such that the other EDG could have reached the output
               breaker trip settings during a LOOP event, both EDGs would be inoperable and FCS
               would have to take action per Technical Specification (TS) 2.0.1. It is conservative
               to assume that such conditions existed for those EDG outages that exceeded six hours.
               However, actions were not taken for two inoperable EDGs per the requirements of TS
               2.0.1, resulting in operation or condition prohibited by TS. A cause analysis is in
               progress. The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER.</abstract>
   <narrative>
      <background>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor
         coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. There are two installed safety
         related Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). These units provide reliable in-plant AC
         electrical power when no off-site electrical power is available. Each EDG can provide
         adequate in-plant AC power for safe shutdown of the plant and operation of the required
         engineered safeguards equipment in the event of a design basis accident (DBA). The EDGs and
         auxiliary systems are designed so that a single failure coincident with a loss of offsite
         power will not prevent safe plant shutdown. The EDGs are maintained in standby during
         normal and shutdown plant operations. In the event that low voltage on a 4160 volt (V) bus
         is detected, the associated EDG will automatically start. Automatic load sequencing occurs
         with accident signals. Technical Specification (TS) 2.7 specifies the limiting conditions
         for operations, specifications, and minimum requirements for FCS electrical systems. Two
         EDGs are required with provisions for single EDG inoperability. Inoperability of both EDGs
         would place FCS in TS 2.0.1 as there are no actions for two inoperable EDGs. TS 2.0.1
         applies to the operable status of all systems, subsystems, trains, components, or devices
         covered by the Limiting Conditions for Operation. This specification delineates corrective
         measures to be taken for circumstances not directly provided for in the system specific
         specifications and whose occurrence would violate the intent of the specification.</background>
      <eventDesc>An Engineering review identified that a potential issue existed concerning
         Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) capability to power required loads in certain loss of
         offsite power (LOOP) scenarios, specifically those scenarios during which a Loss of Coolant
         Accident (LOCA) or Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) does not occur. In a LOOP without a
         concurrent accident signal, the 480 V load shed that would be initiated as a direct result
         of the accident signal does not occur. Therefore, the electrical load that the EDGs must
         pick up when the EDG output breaker automatically closes could be significantly higher than
         the dead load that exists in an accident scenario. A review of design basis calculations
         and engineering analyses has identified several evaluations that consider the EDG dead load
         during accidents. However, no documents evaluating EDG dead loads in non-accident
         conditions were found. If one EDG were inoperable due to maintenance or other activities
         and the electrical distribution system loading conditions were such that the other EDG
         could have reached the output breaker trip settings during a loss of offsite power (LOOP)
         event, both EDGs would be inoperable and FCS would have to take action per TS 2.0.1. It is
         conservative to assume that such conditions existed for those EDG outages that exceeded six
         hours. However, actions were not taken for two inoperable EDGs per the requirements of TS
         2.0.1, resulting in operation or condition prohibited by TS. This report is being submitted
         in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), operation or condition prohibited by Technical
         Specifications and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), event or condition that could have prevented
         the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate
         the consequences of an accident. This LER reports a condition where analyses have not been
         found that would support operating practices, resulting in periods of EDG inoperability in
         excess of TS allowed limits. The initial Operations review focused on the current operating
         conditions, noting that the condition would need to be resolved prior to start up. The station paradigm
         inappropriately concluded that reportability could be evaluated at a later date since
         current operating conditions were not challenged, and that the 60-day reporting window
         commenced when the event was determined to be reportable. FCS has been systematically
         addressing issues that have been identified since June 2011, in response to the flooding
         conditions, switchgear fire, and increased oversight. This LER is being submitted beyond
         the 60-day regulatory reporting requirement due to non-conservative decisions with respect
         to procedural and regulatory reportability requirements and resource constraints caused by
         the operating challenges which began in June 2011.
