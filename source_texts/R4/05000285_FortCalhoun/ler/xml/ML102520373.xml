This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety injection Tanks FilVDrain Valve) when containment integrity was required and inadequate administrative controls were implemented. In preparation for performing a leak check ofthe safety injection tanks leakoff piping, a procedural step in the surveillance test opened manual containment isolation valve SI-410, as well as re-aligning other valves. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system to be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant systembeing greater than 210 degrees F; thus, containment integrity is required. Prior to the performance ofthe ST on November 1,2009, it was recognized that the opening ofSI-410 needed to be administratively controlled. The ST procedure was revised to require administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SI-410. A root cause analysis determined that training on containment integrity to specifically meet the intent of TS 2.6(1)a, as defined in the TS basis section, is insufficient to ensure complete understanding ofthe requirements.

(2) The equipment hatch is properly closed and sealed. (3) The personnel air lock satisfies Specification 2.6(1)b. (4) All automatic containment isolation valves are operable, locked closed, or deactivated and secured in their closed position (or isolated by locked closed valves or blind flanges as permitted by a limiting condition for operation). (5) The uncontrolled containment leakage satisfies Specification 3.5, and (6) The sealing mechanism associated with each penetration (e.g., welds, bellows or a-rings) is operable. TS section 2.6(1 )a, states: &quot;Containment integrity shall not be violated unless the reactor is in a cold or refueling shutdown condition. Without containment integrity, restore containment integrity within one hour or be in at least hot shutdown within the next 6 hours, in at least subcritical and less than 300 degrees F within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Normally locked or sealed-closed valves (except for PCV742AIBIC/D) may be opened intermittently under administrative control without constituting a violation of containment integrity.&quot; The TS basis provides the following additional information: &quot;The opening oflocked or sealed closed containment isolation valves on an intermittent basis under administrative control includes the following considerations: (1) stationing an operator, who is in constant communication with the control room, at the valve controls, (2) instructing this operator to close these valves in an accident situation, and (3) assuring that environmental conditions will not preclude access to close the valves and that this action will prevent the release of radioactivity outside the containment.&quot; EVENT DESCRIPTION Containment integrity was violated on November 1, 2009. This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve) when containment integrity was required and inadequate administrative controls were implemented. Prior to November 1,2009, a step existed in QC-ST-SI-3006, &quot;Safety Injection LeakoffPiping Forty Month Functional Test,&quot; to open manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety Injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve), as well as re-aligning other valves, in preparation for performing a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoff piping. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 degrees Fahrenheit and containment integrity required. Prior to the ST being performed on November 1, 2009, it was recognized by a shift manager that the opening of SI-41 0 needed to be administratively controlled in order to be in compliance with TS 2.6(1 )a. However, this thought was in error since the TS bases prohibit this valve from being opened when the plant is greater than 210 degrees Fahrenheit. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) I-'KIN II::U UN KI::(;Y(;LED PAPEK </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

A note, a caution, and a step were added at the beginning of the procedure section to require that an operator be assigned to close manual containment isolation valve SI-410 when directed by the control room, to establish containment integrity. However, environmental conditions during an accident could preclude an operator from shutting SI-41O during an accident. An extent of condition review from LER 2009-004 noted the violation ofthe TS basis information. The review determined that the station entered and subsequently violated TS 2.6(1)a on November 1, 2009, as a result of opening valve SI-41O when containment integrity was required. This issue was identified and documented in Condition Report (CR) 2010-1664. This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). CONCLUSION A root cause analysis determined that training on containment integrity to specifically meet the intent of TS I 2.6(1)a, as defined in the TS basis section, is insufficient to ensure complete understanding ofthe requirements. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The revision of training materials and retraining of appropriate plant personnel will be administered using the I station's corrective action program. Revisions to appropriate plant documents will also be administered by the corrective action program. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE There was no impact to safety in ways previously not evaluated in the USAR. Since the plant was in mode 3, the opening of SI-410 without administrative control constituted a violation of containment integrity per TS 2.6(1)a. However, SI-41O being open did not provide a leak pathway from containment to the external atmosphere. Pressure boundary was maintained during the test since the downstream isolation valves were closed for the portion of the piping that was outside of containment. The downstream isolation valves are a normally closed automatic valve and normally locked closed manual valve. For the performances of QC-ST -SI-3006 during the 2003,2006 and 2009 refueling outages (RFOs), control room log data indicate that the downstream isolation valves were both closed during performances of the test. Therefore, the containment integrity violation was entirely administrative and nuclear safety was not compromised. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
