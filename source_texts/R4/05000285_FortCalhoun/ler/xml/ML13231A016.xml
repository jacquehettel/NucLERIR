PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -007 -1 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION Condition Report (CR) 2013-02260 identified that a summary structural analysis (FC03901) indicated that VA-15A/B (Containment Air Cooler/Filter) plenum was overstressed by 100 percent and that VA-16A/B (Containment Air Cooler) plenum would have been overstressed during a design basis seismic event. At the time of discovery, FC03901 indicated that VA-15A/B required cross-bracing, which had been added during initial plant construction resulting in the equipment being operable. Since VA-16A/B was overstressed, they were considered inoperable. During an inspection, the NRC questioned the operability determination provided in CR 2013-02260 for VA-15A/B and VA-16A/B due to the seismic criteria not being met.  The station responded that since the cross-bracing had been added to VA-15A/B during initial plant construction, they were considered operable.  However, VA-16A/B did not meet the current licensing basis and were considered inoperable.  On April 6, 2013, CR 2013-07674 was initiated and a reportability evaluation determined that the condition was reportable.  The unit was defueled when the condition was identified. This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant’s Technical Specifications. CONCLUSION During Manual Chapter 0350 inspection activities, the NRC found and questioned an original plant design calculation from 1973 which indicated that containment ventilation cooling unit VA-15A&amp;B and VA-16A&amp;B plenums have stress points beyond yield.  CR 2013-05570 &quot;FCS Design and License Basis Configuration Control,” documents broader issues with design and licensing basis configuration control. A Root Cause Analysis for CR 2013-05570 was performed and two root causes were identified that apply: Root Cause 1 – OPPD Design basis information was incomplete at the beginning of commercial operation. This initial condition, combined with a weakness in licensing basis knowledge and a failure to internalize the importance of the design basis, resulted in the organization missing repeated opportunities to correct the initial deficiencies and additional errors were created over time. Root Cause 2 – The early culture established standards and expectations for the organization that resulted in behaviors demonstrating that the operation of the facility was more important than maintaining the license and design basis of the Station. This early culture established long-standing, reinforced, and institutionalized behaviors that have resisted external and internal efforts to change. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The station will verify that the VA-16A/B plenums are restored to an operable condition. The causes associated with the plenum structural analysis will be addressed by the corrective actions in CR 2013-05570 &quot;FCS Design and License Basis Configuration Control.” </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13231A016_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2013 -007 -1 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The containment cooling system consists of two smaller cooling units (VA-16 A/B) and two large cooling and filtering units (VA-15 A/B).  All four of the units are cooled by the component cooling water system which is in turn cooled by the raw water system (from the ultimate heat sink).  These units are designed to cool the containment during both normal and accident conditions.  The operation of any of the units following a seismic event will maintain adequate cooling for the containment building. The potential deformation of the cooler housing is unlikely to have a significant impact on the integrity of the component cooling water system. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This issue does not constitute a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI 99-02, Revision 6. PREVIOUS EVENTS LERs 2013-001, 2012-020, 2012-014 and 2012-010 document issues with seismic qualification. </Figure></TaggedPDF-doc>
