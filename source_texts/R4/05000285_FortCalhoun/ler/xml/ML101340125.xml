The regulator pressure setting of 23.6 psig is contrary to the required nominal setting of 35 psig credited in calculation FC06904, &quot;Category 1 Air-Operated Valve (AOV) Operator Margin Analysis.&quot; (HCV -1107 A is an air-to-close valve.) The root causes of this event were determined to be: The most probable root cause of this event is that in 2006 a technician, who knew the standard practice was to set the regulator a minimum of 5 psig greater than the highest benchset, set the regulator at the wrong pressure. The technician noted the benchset flowscan on October 27, 2006, was 17.91 psig and set the regulator to 22.91 psig (nearly 23 psig). This adjustment was not covered by a written instruction. The latent root cause of this event was the adjustment would have been an action not covered by any existing retrievable written instructions. The fundamental flawed assumptions and weak work practice reflected the cultural norms and values that existed in the Instrumentation and Control maintenance organization in 2006.

Each loop has one steam generator (SG) and two reactor coolant pumps (RCPs). Each SG has one main feedwater (MFW) nozzle and one auxiliary feedwater (AFW) nozzle. The MFW nozzle is the normal path for feeding the SGs. </P><P>The AFW system is provided for storage, pumping and delivery ofmakeup water to the SGs in order to remove </P><P>decay heat if the MFW system is not available. The AFW system consists of one emergency feedwater storage </P><P>tank; one safety-related motor-driven (FW-6), one safety-related turbine-driven (FW-IO) AFW pump; one nonsafety-related, diesel-driven AFW pump (FW-54); one non-safety-related diesel fuel oil transfer pump with a day </P><P>tank; non-safety-related fuel oil piping and valves; remotely operated flow control valves; interconnecting piping </P><P>to the MFW system and piping to the AFW nozzles on the SGs. </P><P>The AFW line to each SG has an isolation valve on the inside of containment (the 'A' valves) and one on the outside of containment (the 'B' valves). The HCV-1107 AlB valves are the isolation valves for the 'A' SG. The HCV-1108AIB valves are the isolation valves for the 'B' SG. The AFW isolation valves are 3-inch, pneumatically operated globe valves. These valves are air to close and spring to open. </P><P>FW-54 is the startup AFW pump. FW-54 takes its suction from the condensate storage tank and discharges to the normal feedwater header. FW-54 and its associated equipment are not safety-related. </P><P>The AFW system provides a redundant means of supplying one or both SGs with feedwater. Operation ofthe </P><P>safety-related portion ofthe AFW system is automatically initiated on a low SG water level or manually initiated </P><P>as follows: </P><L><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>Automatic initiation via an auxiliary feedwater actuation signal (AF AS). </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>Automatic start signals to the safety-related pumps (FW-6 and FW-10). </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>Manual initiation from the control room. </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>Manual initiation from alternate shutdown panel for FW-10 and the AFW injection valves and locally for 
FW-6. 
</LI_Title></LI></L><P>The system is designed to add feedwater to either or both SGs under any condition, including the loss ofall electrical power along with the loss ofthe MFW system and the loss ofthe main steam piping downstream ofthe main steam isolation valves. The AFW system fulfills both safety-related and non-safety-related functions. </P><P>Technical Specification (TS) 2.5, &quot;Steam and Feedwater Systems,&quot; states, in part: </P><P>(1) Two AFW trains shall be OPERABLE when Tcold is above 300 (degrees) F. </P><P>A. 	With one steam supply to the turbine driven AFW pump inoperable, restore the steam supply to OPERABLE status within 7 days and within 8 days from discovery of failure to meet the LCO. </P><P>B. 	With one AFW train inoperable for reasons other than condition A, restore the AFW train to OPERABLE status within 24 hours. </P><P>C. 	If the required action and associated completion times of condition A or B are not met, then the unit shall be placed in MODE 2 in 6 hours, in MODE 3 in the next 6 hours, and less than 300 (degrees) F without reliance on the steam generators for decay heat removal within the next 18 hours. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) 	PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><P>· &quot;. </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>CONTINUATION SHEET

The station entered mode 5 (less than 210 degrees F, </P><P>refueling) on November 2, 2009. On November 6,2009, during performance of air operated valve diagnostic </P><P>testing ofHCV-1107A, the air regulator setting was found to be 23.6 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The </P><P>regulator pressure setting of 23.6 psig is contrary to the required nominal setting of 35 psig credited in calculation </P><P>FC06904, &quot;Category 1 Air-Operated Valve (AOV) Operator Margin Analysis.&quot; (HCV-II07A is an air-to-close </P><P>v~lve.) A root cause analysis was initiated to determine the cause of the apparent failure of the valve. By </P><P>December 12,2009, the causal analysis had progressed to the point where it was concluded that the valve's 
regulator had been inadvertently set to the wrong pressure setting during a previous refueling outage. 
</P><P>HCV -1107 A has a safety-related function to shut to isolate AFW flow to a SG as well as to open to allow AFW </P><P>flow to a SG. With the valve regulator set to 23.6 psig, HCV-II07A was unable to perform its design safety </P><P>function for longer than the TS allowed outage time. </P><P>Based on the root cause analysis, the date of discovery for this report was determined to be December 12,2009, </P><P>instead of the date of the test on November 6,2009. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR </P><P>50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>In the fall of2006 FCS conducted a SG replacement refueling outage. On September 11,2006, work order (WO) 218003/01 paperwork was issued to remove and install the valve operator for HCV -1107 A per the applicable I portions of procedure PE-RR-VX-0414S, &quot;Inspection and Repair of Safety Related Fisher 'HSC' Valves.&quot; An &quot;As Found&quot; flowscan ofHCV-1107A was performed on September 11,2006. This identified that the input pressure was adjusted slightly greater than 35 psig. The stem coupling and regulator from HCV -1107 A were removed on September 12,2006, for storage. An as found diagnostic test (Flowscan) was performed on HCV-II07A and its actuator. (Flowscan is a diagnostic device and methodology used to perform baseline or diagnostic testing on AOV and their actuators.) When HCV-II07A was reinstalled, the &quot;As Left&quot; Flowscan dated October 27,2006, identified that the input pressure to the flow scanner was adjusted to slightly greater than 23 psig. </P><P>In the period of time between the flowscan of September 11, 2006, and the flowscan of October 27, 2006, the air regulator for HCV-II07A setting was reset to 23.6 psig instead of35 psig as specified. There is no record of any activity during those dates that would have changed the regulator setting from the required 35psig to 23.6 psig. The plant records do not show any maintenance on the regulator for HCV -1107 A prior to September 11, 2006, or I after November 2, 2006. </P><P>The as-left setting ofthe air regulator for HCV -1107 A at 23.6 psig went undetected by station personnel until the 
performance of AOV diagnostic testing ofHCV-1107A on November 6,2009. The regulator pressure setting of 
</P><P>23.6 psig is contrary to the required nominal setting of 35 psig credited in calculation FC06904, &quot;Category 1 Air
Operated Valve (AOV) Operator Margin Analysis." 
</P><P>The root causes of this event were determined to be: </P><P>1. 	The most probable root cause of this event is that in 2006 an Instrument and Controls (I&amp;C) technician, who knew the standard practice was to set the regulator a minimum of 5 psig greater than the highest benchset, set the regulator at the wrong pressure; The I&amp;C technician noted the benchset flowscan on October 27,2006, was 17.91 psig and set the regulator to 22.91 psig (nearly 23 psig). This adjustment was not covered by a written instruction. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

The latent root cause of this event was the adjustment would have been an action not covered by any existing retrievable written instructions. The fundamental flawed assumptions and weak work practice reflected the cultural norms and values that existed in the I&amp;C maintenance organization in 2006. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The air regulator for HCV-II07A was reset from 23.6 psig to 35 psig. Additional actions will be administered by the corrective action system. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE HCV-II07A is a normally closed, air-to-close / spring-to-open valve. This valve has a safety function to open to allow AFW flow to an intact steam generator and to close to NOT feed a failed / depressurized steam generator. The valve fails open upon loss of DC power to the solenoid valve, or upon loss of the air supply. However, the valve has an air accumulator installed to permit three (open and closed) cycles in 8 hours after loss of the normal air supply. Based on the as-found regulator setting of23.6 psig, it was determined that, even when positioned &quot;closed&quot;, HCV-ll07A would remain approximately 28 percent open. During power operations HCV-II07A would not have isolated AFW flow to Steam Generator RC-2A by itself. However, the redundant containment isolation valve HCV-II07B, located in Rm 81, was capable of isolating AFW flow to RC-2A if needed during design ba~is accident conditions. Past surveillance tests and maintenance history showed that HCV -11 07B has been reliable. The ability to adequately remove decay heat via the steam generators was not adversely impacted. Therefore this event has a minimal impact on the health and safety of the public. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
