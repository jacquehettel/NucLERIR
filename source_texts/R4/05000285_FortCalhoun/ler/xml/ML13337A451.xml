The original condition was identified on October 18, 2012, which identified unqualified components in the control loop whose failure could cause a spurious closure of HCV-1369 and result in pump damage. The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. The condition was entered in to the station's corrective action program as Condition Report 2013-18752.

PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -013 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering design. FCS Technical Specification (TS) Section 2.5 states, in part that, two auxiliary feedwater (AFW) trains shall be OPERABLE when Tcold is above 300°F and with one AFW train inoperable for reasons other than Condition A, inoperable steam supply, restore the AFW train to OPERABLE status within 24 hours. FCS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 9.4.1 states, in part that, FCS has two safety class auxiliary feed pumps, each capable of meeting system requirements and with diverse power sources; one electric motor driven and the other steam turbine driven. EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 3, 2013 station personnel identified that a condition with the control loop for HCV-1369, Turbine-Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump FW-10 Recirculation Valve, was incorrectly evaluated as not reportable. The original condition was identified on October 18, 2012.  Although FCV-1369 is a fail-open valve, a closure due to a failure of a non-critical quality element (CQE) component coincident with a demand closure of HCV-1107B, Steam Generator RC-2A Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve and HVC-1108B, Steam Generator RC-2B Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve, could result in damage to FW-10 due to cavitation.  FW-10 is the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump.  The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. The current review determined that the components in question, although procured as CQE, had not been maintained as CQE. Additionally, the control loop is classified as non-CQE; therefore, the associated cables were not routed in safety related cable trays.  The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. Although the condition only applies to the turbine-driven AFW pump (FW-10), during the last operating cycle the motor-driven AFW pump (FW-6) was taken out of service for testing. This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant’s Technical Specifications. CONCLUSION Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Engineering is reviewing this condition and the results of this review will be used to update this report. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13337A451_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.
