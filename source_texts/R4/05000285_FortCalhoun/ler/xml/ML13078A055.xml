The seismic test results stated that the GE HFA relays passed the seismic testing, but the relays required two screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds. This condition of the additional required torqueing was initially entered into the corrective action program on December 21, 2012. Currently, approximately 136 relays, that provide various indication and control functions in systems such as high pressure safety injection, charging, containment ventilation, and the emergency diesel generator, have been identified as potentially affected.

PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -001 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 15, 2013, while reviewing a previous condition report, it was identified that a previous operability determination (OD) completed for General Electric (GE) model HFA relays was incorrect in that it did not appear to fully address the condition of the mounting screws that required torqueing. The seismic test results stated that the GE HFA relays passed the seismic testing, but the relays required two screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds.  This condition of additional required torqueing was initially entered into the corrective action program on December 21, 2012. Extent of condition reviews estimate approximately 136 relays, that provide various indication and control functions in systems such as high pressure safety injection, charging, containment ventilation, and the emergency diesel generator, are potentially affected.  A cause analysis is in progress, the results of which will be published in a supplement to this LER. At approximately 2355 Central Standard Time (CST) on February 27, 2013, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations office (HOO), under 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), unanalyzed condition, reporting this event.  During the notification, the event date identified was incorrectly stated as February 26, 2013. This is the date that the initial operability determination was called into question.  The correct event date is December 21, 2012.  This is the date which OPPD acknowledged that the vendor identified the GE HFAs relays did pass the seismic testing, but the relays required two screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds to pass the testing. This report is being submitted in accordance with 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B): any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety.  If additional reporting criteria are identified during the causal analysis, the results will be published in a supplement to this LER. CONCLUSION A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Replacement/torqueing of the affected relays is underway.  A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13078A055_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.
