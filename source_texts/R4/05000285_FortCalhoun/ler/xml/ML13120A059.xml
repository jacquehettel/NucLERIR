FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 4 OF 5 2013 -005 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET Fort Calhoun Station was licensed prior to the General Design Criteria and Standard Review Plan. The station was designed in accordance with the 70 draft General Design Criteria published for comment in the Federal Register (32 FR 10213) on July 11, 1967.  Criterion 2 of the 70 draft General Design Criteria, which discusses tornadoes and appears in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), is provided below. CRITERION 2 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS Those systems and components of reactor facilities which are essential to the prevention of accidents which could affect public health and safety or to mitigation of their consequences shall be designed, fabricated, and erected to performance standards that will enable the facility to withstand, without loss of the capability to protect the public, the additional forces that might be imposed by natural phenomena such as earthquakes, tornadoes, flooding conditions, winds, ice and other local site effects. The design bases so established shall reflect: (a) Appropriate consideration for the most severe of these natural phenomena that have been recorded for the site and the surrounding area and (b) an appropriate margin for withstanding forces greater than those recorded to reflect uncertainties about the historical data and their suitability as a basis for design. USAR Section 9.10.2.4, Revision 22, Control Room Air Conditioning System, contains the following system discussion. The control room air conditioning system consists of two, air cooled split system package air conditioning units, each rated at 100 percent of the system design capacity, and supply and return ductwork. The system is designed for normal operation at 18,000 cubic feet per minute total air volume with 1000 CFM of outside ventilating air makeup.  The air cooled condensers for each Freon refrigeration unit is located on the auxiliary building roof above Room 69.  The air condenser units are protected from tornado winds [360 mph] with a windscreen.  Standard Review Plan (SRP) Section 2.2.3 was used to design the air cooled condensers windscreen.  The SRP criteria was met, therefore, no tornado missile shielding for the air cooled condensers is required. The control room HVAC is an essential auxiliary support system and hence, is part of the plant's engineered safeguards, as defined in Section 6. EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 27, 2013, while reviewing a response to an NRC 0350 question, an issue was identified where the modification which moved the control room air conditioners condensers from inside the control room to the auxiliary building roof should have obtained prior NRC approval.  The condensers are located in close proximity to one another and are protected by a grating that is not rated to withstand a tornado missile.  Therefore, it is possible that both the A and B trains could be struck and rendered inoperable by the same missile. The review determined that prior NRC approval had not been obtained for the modification and the condition was entered in to the station's corrective action program (CR 2013-04266). At the time of discovery, the unit was shutdown with fuel removed. A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13120A059_img_5.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.
