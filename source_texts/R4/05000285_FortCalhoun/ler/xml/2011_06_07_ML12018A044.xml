   <abstract>On June 7, 2011, a bus fault in load center 1B4A initiated a switch gear fire that
      resulted in the opening of a circuit breaker which supplies power to load center 1B3A,
      associated with the opposite train. A fire in one fire area that resulted in a loss of power
      to a load center associated with the opposite train is not in compliance with 10 CFR 50,
      Appendix R. The analysis assumes that a fire in a fire area affecting one train of power will
      be isolated such that power associated with the redundant train will be maintained. A root
      cause analysis is being performed to determine the cause of the failure. The affected bus was
      de-energized and the Halon system extinguished the fire. The Halon system was recharged and
      restored to service. Inspections and testing of the unaffected 480 V buses, the supply circuit
      breakers to the 480 V buses, and the 480 V bus tie circuit breakers were performed.
      Appropriate 480 V supply circuit breakers and bus tie circuit breakers passed their
      inspections and testing. The fire damaged switchgear (1B4A), which contains two 480V supply
      circuit breakers, 1B4A and BT-1B4A (supply circuit breaker to the associated “island” bus), is
      being replaced. Additional corrective actions will be specified following the completion of
      the root cause analysis.</abstract>
   <narrative>
      <background>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion
         Engineering (CE) design. The plant has six safety-related 480 VAC (V) buses and three 480 V
         safety related “island” cross-tie buses. The island buses are fed from one side or the
         other of the main 480 V buses. Load center 1B3A and 1B3C normally feed island buses in the
         east switchgear room, and 1B4C normally feeds an island bus in the west switchgear room.
         Non-segregated bus work connects each island bus to its alternate power supply on the
         opposite switchgear side. The 480 V bus feeder circuit breakers are NLI/Square D Masterpact
         circuit breakers with Micrologic trip units.</background>
      <eventDesc>On June 7, 2011, a bus fault in load center 1B4A initiated a switch gear fire that
         resulted in the opening of a circuit breaker which supplies power to load center 1B3A,
         associated with the opposite train. The fact that a fire in one fire area resulted in a
         loss of power to a load center associated with the opposite train is inconsistent with
         assumptions made in the 10 CFR 50, Appendix R Safe Shutdown analysis. This compliance
         analysis assumes that a fire in a fire area affecting one train of power will be isolated
         such that power associated with the redundant train will be maintained. Although there was
         local indication at the circuit breaker that the 1B3A main feeder circuit breaker opened
         due to an overcurrent condition, other available information does not conclusively indicate
         that a fault that should have opened the 1B3A main feeder circuit breaker actually
         occurred. Investigation is continuing into the cause of the trip of the 1B3A main feeder
         circuit breaker. On November 15, 2011, this event was determined to be reportable per 10
         CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A), (B), (C) and
         (D). </eventDesc>
      <conclusion>During normal plant operation, 480V load center and bus tie circuit breakers are
         expected to remain closed to provide 480V, three phase power to their associated buses. In
         the event of a fault on the associated bus, a load center circuit breaker or bus tie
         circuit breaker should open to isolate the fault without opening the next circuit breaker
         upstream, i.e., the circuit breakers should coordinate to isolate the fault by preserving
         power to loads not directly impacted by the fault. The FCS 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Safe
         Shutdown Analysis credits coordination of the 480 V load center and bus tie circuit
         breakers for a fire in either switchgear room by assuming that a fault resulting from the
         fire damaged switchgear will be isolated by bus tie circuit breakers associated with the
         opposite train. Isolation of the fault by the bus tie circuit breakers will result in one
         train of AC power remaining in operation during a worst case fire event. The 10 CFR 50,
         Appendix R, Safe Shutdown Analysis demonstrates that the plant can be safely brought to hot
         shutdown from an operating mode and subsequently to cold shutdown with a worst case fire in
         any fire area in the plant. Coordination of plant circuit breakers is analyzed in the FCS,
         “Breaker/Fuse Coordination Study.” The two analyses referenced in this discussion support
         the FCS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) requirement that “Design provisions were made
         to limit fire damage to one train of the electrical systems…” 480 V load center and bus tie
         circuit breakers are expected to remain closed under normal conditions to provide power to
         buses to which they are aligned within the loading limitations as established in operating
         procedures. In the event of a fault on a main bus or island bus, the circuit breaker
         supplying that bus should open to isolate the fault without tripping upstream circuit
         breakers. Load center circuit breakers should not open due to a fault or fire in the
         opposite train. 10 CFR 50, Appendix R design assumptions are that a fire in either the east
         or west switchgear room will result in the loss of switchgear in the affected room, but
         will not impact the operability of the switchgear in the opposite room. During the fire in
         1B4A, the formation of fire residue (soot) on the non-segregated bus stabs within 1B4A
         switchgear bus tie circuit breaker cubicle created fault currents that were sensed by
         circuit breaker 1B3A. At the time of the event, circuit breaker BT-1B4A was open and
         circuit breaker BT-1B3A was closed supplying island bus 1B3A-4A. An NRC Part 21 (2005-039)
         addressed spurious tripping of the Micrologic trip devices, and the supplier Nuclear
         Logistics Incorporated (NLI) added a filter capacitor to the trip module. Additionally, a
         subsequent industry spurious trip of NLI/Square D Masterpact circuit breakers in 2008 (OE
         21873) resulted in a design change to the trip module. The NLI/Square D Masterpact circuit
         breakers replaced in 2009, contained the industry operating experience of the Micrologic
         trip units, and the vendor confirmed the FCS trip units contained the upgrades driven by
         the NRC Part 21 (2005-039). </conclusion>
      <correctiveAction>As documented in LER 2011-008 (Fire in Bus 1B4A) the following actions have
         been or are being taken: The affected bus was de-energized and the Halon system
         extinguished the fire. The Halon system was recharged and restored to service. FCS
         conducted inspections and testing of the unaffected 480 V buses, the supply circuit
         breakers to the 480 V buses, and the 480 V bus tie circuit breakers. The tested 480 V
         supply circuit breakers and bus tie circuit breakers passed their inspections and testing.
         FCS is replacing the affected bus (1B4A), which contains two 480 V supply circuit breakers,
         1B4A and BT-1B4A (supply circuit breaker to the associated “island” bus). Additional
         corrective actions will be determined following completion of the root cause for this
         event. </correctiveAction>
      <safetySignificance>The safety significance will be fully evaluated following completion of
         the root cause analysis for this event. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does
         result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with
         NEI-99-02.</safetySignificance>
