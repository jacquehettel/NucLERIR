PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIALNUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 4 2012 -018 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND System Description The containment air cooling and filtering system (CACFS) is designed to perform a nuclear safety function of filtering and cooling the containment building atmosphere during normal plant operation and accident conditions.  During accident conditions, the CACFS is designed to limit the leakage of airborne activity from the containment and reduce containment pressures in the event of a LOCA. During normal plant operations, CACFS cools the containment atmosphere and provides filtration required prior to personnel access. The CACFS consists of four air handling units each with a fan and heat exchanger. They discharge to a common plenum. There are two types of units. Two units (VA-3A, VA-3B) have filtering capacity while the other two air cooling units (VA-7C, VA-7D) do not have filtering capacity. The air cooling units are similar in design to the cooling and filtering units but do not include mist eliminators, HEPA filters, or charcoal filters. License Amendment No. 255 approved the change where the CACFS components are combined into a train consisting of one containment air filtering and cooling unit, and one containment cooling unit that are associated to the same emergency diesel generator. Therefore, the two trains of containment air cooling and filtering components are: (VA-3A and VA-7C) which are associated with diesel generator DG-1 and (VA-3B and VA-7D) which are associated with diesel generator DG-2 Below is a partial plant drawing of the CACFS components discussed in the Event Description. </Figure><Part><H6>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </H6><P>(10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </P><Table><TR><TH>1.

The review of Condition Report (CR) 2009-6610 identified that on the previous day VA-7C and VA-7D failed the acceptable pressure drop range of 3.3 to 5.0 inches water column (WC) as specified in surveillance test IC-STVA-0013. </P><P>Under Steps 7.3 and &amp; 7.4 of the referenced surveillance is a note which states “*It is desired to have one fan in the ON position to minimize back pressure during VA-7C/D test”. The following step (7.3.1 or 7.4.1) has Operations place fan combinations in service with desired and actual fan combinations. The desired position category allows Operations to interpret the note found above the step (3.4.1 or 7.4.1) (see below). </P><P>The test was re-performed a day later and during the re-test during the 2009 refueling outage the note was interpreted incorrectly and both VA-3A and VA-3C were left running during the individual testing of the VA-7C and VA-7D units. Running this fan configuration increases backpressure, reducing measured flow, resulting in what appeared to be a successful test. What was not recognized at the time was that the test violated train separation of the containment cooling fans, therefore, the FCS failed to meet the surveillance testing requirements and was outside the conditions described in technical specifications. The step is shown below: </P><P>7.3 [7.4] Pressure Drop of VA-7C (Data Sheet 3)
