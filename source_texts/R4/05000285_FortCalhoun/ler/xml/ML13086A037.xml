FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -002 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. The FCS chemical and volume control system (CVCS) consists in part of three charging pumps that take suction from the volume control tank and return the coolant to the reactor coolant system by way of the shell side of the regenerative heat exchanger.  The heat exchanger transfers heat from the letdown coolant to the charging coolant before the charging coolant is returned to the reactor coolant system. Although the three charging pumps start upon receipt of an Engineered Safeguards signal, no credit is taken for charging pump operation in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) safety analyses and as such these pumps are not classified as Engineered Safeguards equipment. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 25, 2013, while preparing for a charging and letdown piping modification, it was identified that the assumed stiffness values of the supports are higher than originally documented.  As a result, the supports are much more rigid and result in overstressing a portion of the Class 2 charging (CH-2014) piping.  Failure of the piping could result in release of radioactive material through penetration M-3 due to the lack of double isolation.  The plant was shutdown and defueled when this condition was identified and entered in to the corrective action program. Further analysis determined that the new calculated stiffness values over stressed the piping, which could result in pipe failure in the charging Class 2 piping during a seismic event.  The Class 1 portion of the charging and Class 1 and 2 portions of the letdown piping were unaffected. This report is being submitted in accordance with 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to control the release of radioactive material. If additional reporting criteria are identified during the causal analysis, the results will be published in a supplement to this LER. CONCLUSION A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The CVCS system was previously declared inoperable due to the condition described in LER 2012-016-0. FCS will analyze and modify the CVCS pipe supports as required to conform to the piping load requirements. This action will be completed before core reload. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13086A037_img_2.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2013 -002 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Failure of the piping could result in release of radioactive material through penetration M-3 due to the lack of double isolation.  The charging and HPSI pumps are credited for maintaining containment pressure during a LOCA. Therefore, if the Class 2 charging line were to break during a LOCA, the charging or HPSI pumps may not be able to maintain pressure at M-3 for a minimum of 30 minutes. However, check valve CH-198 and manual isolation valve CH-194 would be able to isolate the penetration, but are not credited in the analysis. A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS 13 LERs with event dates since January 1, 2010, were identified with the same reporting criteria.  The condition identified in this LER is a latent condition that could not have been prevented by the corrective actions taken as a result of the LERs reviewed. LER 2012-016-0, Unanalyzed Charging System Socket Welds to the Reactor Coolant System, identified a condition where a principal safety barrier was seriously degraded in that: the 2 inch socket welded fittings on RCS branch line piping cannot be qualified, and the 2 inch charging lines are considered to be in an unanalyzed condition exceeding thermal cycle fatigue. The extent of condition performed as a result of the condition identified in LER 2012-016-0 resulted in the identification of the condition reported in this LER. </Figure></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
