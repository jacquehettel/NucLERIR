EXPECTED SUBMISSION DA TE) jgI NO SUBMISSION DATE ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) Containment integrity was unknowingly violated on October 26, 2003, and November 26, 2006, as a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve). This occurred during a surveillance test (ST), when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. In preparation for performing a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoffpiping, a procedural step in the ST opened manual containment isolation valve SI-41O, as well as re-aligning other valves. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 pkig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 deg F; thus, containment integrity is required. Prior to the subsequent performance of the ST on November 1,2009, it was recognized that the opening of SI-41O needed to be administratively controlled. The ST was revised to require administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SI-41 O. The root cause analysis for this event is the reviewer of the change to QC-ST -SI-3006 failed to identify the conflict between required test conditions (i.e., RCS temperature greater than 210 deg F and containment integrity is required) and opening SI-41O (i.e., manual containment isolation valve). </Figure><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

(2) The equipment hatch is properly closed and sealed. (3) The personnel air lock satisfies Specification 2.6(I)b. (4) All automatic containment isolation valves are operable, locked closed, or deactivated and secured in their closed position (or isolated by locked closed valves or blind flanges as permitted by a limiting condition for operation). (5) The uncontrolled containment leakage satisfies Specification 3.5, and (6) The sealing mechanism associated with each penetration (e.g., welds, bellows or O-rings) is operable. TS section 2.6(I)a, states &quot;Containment integrity shall not be violated unless the reactor is in a cold or refueling shutdown condition. Without containment integrity, it must be restored within one hour or the plant mustbe in at least hot shutdown within the next six hours, or be subcritical and less than 300 degrees F within the next six hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Normally locked or sealed-closed valves (except for PCV742AIBICID) may be opened intermittently under administrative control without constituting a violation of containment integrity.&quot; EVENT DESCRIPTION Containment integrity was unknowingly violated on October 26, 2003, and November 26, 2006. This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SIAIO (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve) when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. Prior to November 2009, a step existed in QC-ST-SI-3006, &quot;Safety Injection LeakoffPiping Forty Month Functional Test,&quot; to open manual containment isolation valve SI-410, as well as re-aligning other valves, in preparation for performing a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoff piping. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 deg F and containment integrity being required. Prior to the ST being performed on November I, 2009, it was recognized by a shift manager that the opening of SIAIO needed to be administratively controlled in order to be in compliance with TS 2.6(1)a. On November 1,2009, a revision was made to QC-ST-SI-3006. A note, a caution, and a step were added at the beginning of the procedure section to require that a dedicated operator be assigned to close manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve) when directed by the control room, to establish containment integrity. Nuclear Safety Review Group (NSRG) and System Engineering (SE) personnel performed a review ofpast performances of QC-ST -SI-3006. The review determined that the station unknowingly entered and subsequently violated TS 2.6(1)a on October 26,2003 and November 26,2006 as a result of opening valve SIAIO when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. This issue was identified and documented in Condition Report (CR) 2009-6365. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedure QC-ST -SI -3006 was revised to require that administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SI-4lO. Additional actions will be administered by the corrective action system. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE There was no impact to safety in ways previously not evaluated in the USAR. Since the plant was in mode 3, the opening of SI-41 0 without administrative control constituted a violation of containment integrity per TS 2.6(1 )a. However, SI-410 being open did not provide a leak pathway from containment to external atmosphere. Pressure boundary was maintained during the test since valves HCV-2983 and SI-185 were closed for the portion of the piping that was outside of containment. HCV-2983 and SI-185 are a normally closed automatic valve and normally locked closed manual valve, respectively. For the performances of QC-ST -SI-3006 during the 2003 and 2006 refueling outages (RFOs), control room log data indicate that SI-185 and HCV-2983 were both closed during performances of the test. Therefore, the contaInment integrity violation was entirely administrative and nuclear safety was not compromised. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
