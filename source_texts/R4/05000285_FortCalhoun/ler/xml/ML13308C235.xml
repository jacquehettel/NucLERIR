It was also identified that the MSLB temperature has a longer exposure time than the EEQ temperature of approximately 160 seconds. However, no evaluation or analysis could be found to address why the original EEQ assumptions remained valid as the longer exposure time of the MSLB analysis could result in an adverse impact on environmentally qualified equipment. This condition was identified when Fort Calhoun Station was shutdown and defueled and entered into the station's corrective action program as Condition Report 2011-10129. </P><P>The condition identified on December 13, 2011, was initially reported via Event Notification (EN) No. 47900 as an unanalyzed condition (10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B» on May 04,2012. The initial LER submittal was made on July 23, 2012. These notifications were determined to have been made late. However, FCS subsequently performed a thermal lag analysis to determine the impact of the longer exposure time. The results show that the additional exposure time of the lower MSLB temperature does not adversely affect the EEQ analysis as originally assumed. Therefore, the original condition no longer represents a safety system functional failure and is being recharacterized as not reportable. For completeness, this event report has been updated and is being submitted as a voluntary LER. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>The thermal lag analysis shows that the additional exposure time of the lower MSLB temperature did not adversely affect the EEQ analysis as originally assumed. Therefore, the condition is being recharacterized as not reportable. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS </P><P>The results of the thermal lag analysis are being documented in the updated program basis documentation. The EEQ Harsh Files for the affected equipment have been revised. </P><P>SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE </P><P>The thermal lag analysis showed that the additional exposure time of the lower MSLB temperature did not adversely affect the EEQ analysis as originally assumed. Therefore, no reportable condition </P><P>existed. </P><P>SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE 
This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
