The process of isolating loads on the Motor Control Center (MCC) required securing power to main feedwater isolation valve HCV-1385. Technical Specification (TS) 2.0.1 was entered at 1622 CDT due to HCV1385 being inoperable. At 1740 CDT, insulation on the supply feeder cables to MCC-3A1 was found to be degraded, and the phase 2 feeder cable was shorted to ground. A plant shutdown was commenced at 1740 CDT per the normal shutdown procedure. At 2123 CDT, the reactor was manually tripped from 22 percent reactor power per the normal shutdown procedure. All systems functioned properly. At 2123 CDT, the plant entered Mode 3. At 2233 CDT, HCV-1385 was manually closed and TS 2.6.1(1) was exited. The root cause analysis determined that the guidance in procedure EM-PM-EX-I100, &quot;480 Volt Motor Control Center Maintenance,&quot; is inadequate to ensure that MCC-3A1 feeder cable lugs are properly torqued to the cables. This led to the high resistance connection at the phase 2 cable lug, overheating and degradation ofthe cable, and the subsequent ground on bus IB3A. The feeder cable to MCC-3Al was repaired and the ground cleared. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><P>':'I~Y .!.~~ ',t l~ &quot; &quot;1:,,\ /&quot; &quot;S ',&quot;'1 &quot; 'i'&quot; </P><P>, ' 1,'</P><P>f l; ~ .' </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Exceptions to these requirements shall be stated in the individual specifications. TS 2.6. 1 (a) states: Containment integrity shall not be violated unless the reactor is in a cold or refueling shutdown condition. Without containment integrity, restore containment integrity within one hour or be in at least hot shutdown within the next 6 hours, in at least subcritical and less than 300 degrees Fahrenheit within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Normally locked or sealed-closed valves (except for PCV -742A1B/C/D) may be opened intermittently under administrative control without constituting a violation of containment integrity. System Description Steam generators (SG) feedwater isolation is provided by the following valves: Main feedwater isolation valves HCV-1385 and HCV-1386, Outlet isolation valves HCV-1103 and HCV-II04 (for their respective feedwater regulation valve (FRV» and FRV bypass valves HCV-II05 and HCV-II06. A Steam Generator Isolation Signal (SGIS) will close HCV-1385/1386, HCV-I10311104 and HCV-II05/1106. EVENT DESCRIPTION At 0238 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on April 8, 2010, a ground alarm for 480 Volt Bus IB3A was indicating intermittently. Ground isolation efforts were conducted with the ground alarm coming in and out intermittently. At 0510 CDT, the ground alarm for 480 Volt Bus IB3A locked in again and remained locked in until 1626 CDT when the ground was isolated to Motor Control Center (MCC)-3Al. MCC-3Al was removed from service and Abnormal Operating Procedure (AOP)-32, &quot;Loss of4160 Volt or 480 Volt Bus Power,&quot; Section VII was entered. At 1622 CDT, an electrical ground on 480 Volt Bus IB3A was determined to be from a supply cable to MCC-3Al. Isolating loads on this MCC required securing power to HCV-1385, Steam Generator RC-2B Inlet Isolation Valve. TS 2.0.1 was entered at 1622 CDT due to HCV-1385 being inoperable (per the station's Technical Data Book (TDB)-VIII guidance). At 1740 CDT, insulation on the supply feeder cables to MCC-3Al was found to be degraded, and the phase 2 feeder cable was shorted to ground. A plant shutdown was commenced at 1740 CDT per Operating Procedure (OP)-4, Load Change and Normal Power Operation. At 2123 CDT, the reactor was manually tripped from 22 percent reactor power per normal shutdown procedures. The plant then transitioned from TS 2.0.1 (1) to TS 2.6.1 a. All systems functioned properly. At 2123 CDT, the plant entered Mode 3. At 2233 CDT, HCV-1385 was manually closed and TS 2.6 was exited. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC t-UKM 366p.

Additional review detennined that this event is not unanalyzed and therefore should not have been reported per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). The reactor was tripped as part of the planned reactor shutdown to repair the MCC. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A). CONCLUSION The root cause analysis detennined that the guidance in procedure EM-PM-EX-II00, &quot;480 Volt Motor Control Center Maintenance,&quot; is inadequate to ensure that MCC-3Al feeder cable EA124 cable lugs are properly torqued to the cables. This led to the high resistance connection at the phase 2 cable lug, overheating and degradation of cable EA124, and the subsequent ground on bus IB3A. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The feeder cable to MCC-3Al was repaired, the loose connection fixed and the ground cleared. The corrective action system (condition report 2010-1704) will administer additional actions as part of the corrective action process. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Although one ofthe isolation valves for the steam generator was not operable for a short period of time (approximately 6 hours), the other isolation valves in the flow path were operable. One of the barriers to radioactive release was nonfunctional; however, the other barrier was operable and available to perfonn the required isolation function. In addition, FW-161; the main feedwater check valve inside containment, is expected to minimize any potential release through this path. Therefore, the impact ofthis event on the public health and safety is minimal. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There have not been any similar events where a cable failure caused a reactor shutdown. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
