The concern was determined to be valid and on December 3,2013, at 0038 CST, an operability evaluation for Condition Report (CR) 2013-22090 confirmed operability of the RW pumps with interim actions to prevent CW flow from the affected 12 inch pipe into the RW vault during a seismic event. Interim compensatory actions to maintain operability of the raw water pumps were to secure the screen wash system and establish a clearance. A clearance was established that disabled the screen wash pumps preventing flow to the RW vault. The RW pumps were determined to be operable with these interim compensatory measures in place. </P><P>This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B), Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (B) Remove residual heat. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>The vulnerability described in this report has existed since the original design and installation of the spray wash system FCS. A cause analysis is in progress and an update to this LER will be provided with additional information. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS 
A design change was completed to the station to eliminate the adverse interaction noted above.
