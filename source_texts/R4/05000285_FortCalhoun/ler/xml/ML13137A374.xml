This condition could have prevented the raw water pumps from being available to provide cooling to the component cooling water system. This condition was entered into the station's corrective action program. The causal analysis determined that station senior management, at the time the condition was identified, did not effectively lead recovery efforts to address the NRC component design basis inspection (CDBI) and FCS self-identified flooding issues in AOP-01. This resulted in important flooding related corrective actions not being effectively planned, prioritized or resourced to ensure a success path for AOP-01 within the established timeline. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13137A374_img_0.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.

PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -001 -1 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 10, 2012, during an inspection of flood preparations by the NRC in response to NRC findings, it was concluded that Abnormal Operating Procedure (AOP) 01 Revision. 28, Acts of Nature, Section I, Flooding, did not adequately protect equipment required to maintain safe shutdown from external flooding to an elevation of 1014 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  This condition could have prevented the raw water pumps from being available to provide cooling to the component cooling water system. This condition was entered into the station's corrective action program as Condition Report 2012-01021. On February 10, 2012, at 1754 CST, an 8-hour report was made under 10 CFR 50.72 (b)(3)(ii)(B) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) (Event Number (EN) 47658).  The initial written report made on April 10, 2012, was made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat and (D), any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Since the initial reporting of this condition, Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) has made the following reports related to this Licensee Event Report (LER): On June 7, 2011, OPPD responded to Notice of Violation (NOV) EA-10-084, Failure to Maintain External Flood Procedures. On April 24, 2013 OPPD responded to NOV EA-13-043, Continued Failure to Classify Intake Structure Sluice Gates as Safety Class 3. CONCLUSION The causal analysis performed as a result of the condition identified in this LER determined that station senior management, at the time the condition was identified, did not effectively lead recovery efforts to address the NRC component design basis inspection (CDBI) and FCS self-identified flooding issues in AOP-01.  This resulted in important flooding related corrective actions not being effectively planned, prioritized or resourced to ensure a success path for AOP-01 within the established timeline. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The corrective actions identified in the responses made on June 7, 2011 and April 24, 2013, in conjunction with these additional actions will reduce the probability of similar events occurring in the future. 1. External senior manager advisors/mentors were contracted to provide guidance and to improve performance in the area of planning, prioritizing, and resource loading station recovery efforts to improve management leadership effectiveness. 2. SO-G-74, Fort Calhoun Station EOP/AOP Generation Program, was revised to require a multi-disciplinary team review for validating AOPs.  The change identifies a specific team member composition for each AOP (CR 2012-01021-024, completed 9/20/12). </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13137A374_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.

SO-G-30, Procedure Changes and Generation, was revised to require a multi-disciplinary team review for validating flood related procedures (CR 2012-01021-023, completed 7/31/12). SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The Fort Calhoun Station is required to be protected from flooding within the station’s licensing basis.  The safety related equipment required to mitigate the consequences of an accident were affected by these findings.  The flood barrier openings could have jeopardized the ability of the safety related equipment to perform their design basis function during an accident.  Although other methods of removing decay heat and mitigating the consequences of a flooding event were available, this external flooding concern has substantial importance to safety as indicated by the Yellow Finding issued for this event. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS Sixteen LERs with event dates since May 1, 2010, were identified with the same reporting criteria. One LER was cancelled and one is the initial submittal of this condition.  Of the remaining 14 LERs, 6 causal analysis were still in progress, but are not expected to determine similar underlying concerns; 6 are not related. Two LERs identified insufficient or ineffective oversight by station leadership as part of the cause of the condition/event and are discussed below. LER 2011-003, Inadequate Flood Protection Due to Ineffective Oversight Identified in February of 2011, a summary of the root causes included: a weak procedure revision process; insufficient oversight of work activities associated with external flood matters; ineffective identification, evaluation and resolution of performance deficiencies related to external flooding; and “safe as is” mindsets relative to external flooding events.  As a result, the corrective actions for previously identified conditions did not resolve issues with AOP-0 1. LER 2011-006, Inoperability of Both Trains of Containment Coolers Due to a Mispositioned Valve Identified in March of 2011, a summary of the root causes included: the station’s leadership oversight effort has not been effective in the areas of use of the station’s Corrective Action Program, human performance tools and safe work practices in reducing the potential for mispositioning events. The weaknesses identified in AOP-01 were already built into the procedure when these previous LERs were being reviewed and corrective actions developed.  In either of these cases, the corrective actions could not have prevented the latent issues discovered in AOP-01.   </Figure></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
