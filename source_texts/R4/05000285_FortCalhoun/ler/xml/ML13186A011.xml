PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -005 -1 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design.  The safety injection system (including three high pressure and two low pressure safety injection pumps and the four safety injection tanks, one safety injection and refueling water storage tank, and interconnecting piping). EVENT DESCRIPTION On May 03, 2013, at approximately 1759 CST, it was identified that the high pressure injection pump injection flows to the reactor coolant system are not balanced in accordance with the Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 14.15.5.2 method for small break loss of coolant analysis (LOCA). FCS is currently shutdown with fuel removed from the vessel. A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v): any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to (B) remove residual heat, and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii): &quot;Any event where a single cause or condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to: (B) Remove residual heat; (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; CONCLUSION A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE A causal analysis is in progress.
