Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 2 OF 3 </P><P>2013 -014 -01 </P><P>NARRATIVE </P><P>BACKGROUND </P><P>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering design. </P><P>FCS Technical Specification (TS) Section 2.5 states, in part that, two auxiliary feed water (AFW) trains </P><P>shall be OPERABLE when Tcold is above 300°F and with one AFW train inoperable for reasons other </P><P>than Condition A, inoperable steam supply, restore the AFW train to OPERABLE status within 24 </P><P>hours. </P><P>FCS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 9.4.1 states, in part that, FCS has two safety </P><P>class auxiliary feed pumps, each capable of meeting system requirements and with diverse power </P><P>sources; one electric motor driven and the other steam turbine driven. </P><P>EVENT DESCRIPTION </P><P>In October of 2012, condition report 2012-15755 identified that the steam driven auxiliary feedwater recirculation valve, FCV-1369, inadvertent closure will cause FW-10 damage. This scenario could result in pump damage and disabling of FW-10. FCV-1369 is not a safety related component (CaE). The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. Although FCV-1369 is a fail-open valve, a closure due to a failure of a non-critical quality element (non-CaE) component coincident with a demand closure of HCV-1107B, Steam Generator RC-2A Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve and HVC-1108B, Steam Generator RC-2B Auxiliary Feedwater Inlet Valve, could result in damage to FW10 due to dead head. FW-10 is the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump. The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. This issue was documented in condition report (CR) 201318752. </P><P>The current review determined that the components in question, although procured as CaE, were not I identified as CaE components. The station was shutdown in MODE 5 when discovered. Although the condition only applies to the turbine-driven AFW pump (FW-10), during the last operating cycle the motor-driven AFW pump (FW-6) was taken out of service for testing. </P><P>This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical SpeCifications. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>The apparent cause was determined to be that the processes used for design and modification of systems, structures, and components do not use explicit and systematic failure mode analysis when adding, deleting, or modifying safety-related system design allowing credible failure modes to not be considered during design and modification. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS </P><P>Immediate Corrective Actions </P><P>HCV-1369 has been locked open to ensure the operability of FW-10 for the current operating cycle. </P><P>NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) </P><P>Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours. </P><P>Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

However, an independent safety related pump (FW-6) would remain available. In addition, a nonsafety related diesel powered AFW pump is available to supply feedwater to the steam generators. </P><P>SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE 
This does not represent a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI 99-02, revision 7.
