   <abstract>A non-conservative error was identified in the input calculation for post-LOCA cooling
      flow (post-RAS (recirculation actuation signal)). The calculation used an incorrect
      (non-conservative) input for LPSI pump performance. The associated procedure (EOP/AOP
      Attachment 11) as written does not provide adequate direction during the Alternate Hot Leg
      Injection mode of operation. Therefore, the procedural guidance may not ensure the completion
      of the safety function of providing adequate core cooling during the Alternate Hot Leg
      Injection mode of operation under a worst case scenario. A cause analysis is in progress and
      the results will be included in a supplement to this LER. Corrective actions to address the

   <narrative>
      <background>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two loop Combustion Engineering, pressurized water
         reactor. The FCS Safety Injection (SI) system consists of three High Pressure Safety
         Injection (HPSI) pumps, associated piping and valves; three Containment Spray (CS) pumps,
         associated piping and valves; and two Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) pumps,
         associated piping and valves. During accident conditions Emergency Operating Procedures
         (EOPs) and Abnormal Operating Procedures (AOPs) are used to ensure safe operation of the
         plant. The primary function of the LPSI system is to provide emergency core cooling
         following a loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA). The LPSI system is designed to achieve this in
         conjunction with the operation of one HPSI pump and one emergency diesel generator during
         worst case accident conditions. Long-term cooling and recirculation are mainly accomplished
         by the HPSI system. However, the LPSI pumps can be used to obtain increased recirculation
         cooling flow once the reactor coolant system pressure is reduced to approximately the same
         as the containment building pressure. The LPSI pumps may be used to inject uncooled water,
         or a portion of their discharge may be diverted through the shutdown cooling heat exchanges
         before being injected back into the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). If only one HPSI pump is
         available, one LPSI pump in conjunction with the available HPSI pump will be used for
         simultaneous hot and cold leg injection in accordance with EOP/AOP Attachment 11,
         “Alternate Hot Leg Injection,” via the shutdown cooling flow path. Hot leg injection is
         normally accomplished with two HPSI pumps via a cross tie to the Chemical Volume and
         Control System (CVCS).</background>
      <eventDesc>The minimum analyzed flow for a LPSI pump is 150 gpm. The calculation does not
         clearly demonstrate that this flow is maintained during some accident conditions. The
         associated procedure (EOP/AOP Attachment 11) as written does not provide adequate direction
         during the Alternate Hot Leg Injection mode of operation to ensure this requirement is met.
         EOP/AOP Attachment 11 requires that RCS pressure be less than 140 pounds per square inch
         absolute (psia) as the entry point for the procedure. The LPSI pumps may not be able to
         meet minimum flow requirements for long term pump operation at this pressure, which could
         result in pump damage. The minimum required RCS hot leg injection flow is 134 gpm may not
         be met with current procedural guidance and instrument accuracy limitations. Therefore,
         procedural guidance may not ensure completion of the safety function of providing adequate
         core cooling during the Alternate Hot Leg Injection mode of operation under a worst case
         scenario. On April 25, 2012, at 1622 Central Daylight Time (CDT) an eight-hour notification
         per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) was made to the Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) (Event
         Number 478620). This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B).</eventDesc>
