Maintenance was in progress on the main generator stator water cooling system when system inventory was lost resulting in an automatic turbine trip due to low system pressure. Immediate response by operations personnel included implementing procedure EOP-OO, Standard Post Trip Actions, and subsequent entry into procedure EOP-01, Reactor Trip Recovery. Based on plant system response this is considered an uncomplicated trip. </P><P>The loss of stator water cooling system inventory occurred during the removal of generator stator water cooling conductivity electrode number CE-5043-1 for calibration. The installed safety knob did not prevent the probe from being removed from the system causing a stator water cooling leak. The technicians were unable to isolate the leak in time to prevent a turbine trip. The leak was isolated shortly after the trip by fully removing the probe and closing the isolation valve. </P><P>At 1455 Central Daylight Time (COT), the Headquarter Operations Officer (HOO) was informed of the event per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) (RPS Actuation) and 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) (Specified System Actuation (RPS)). This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), Specified System Actuation (RPS). </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>Fort Calhoun Station's (FCS's) risk management processes and individual behaviors/mindsets were investigated to determine the root and contributing causes of this event. The RCA team reviewed FCS procedures, standards, and expectations regarding operational risk assessment. Interviews were then conducted to determine if individual behaviors/mindsets and station culture was in line with established expectations. </P><P>The investigation concluded that there were shortfalls in individuals' mindsets and in the level of detail in the Station's risk management procedures. Mindsets and accountability contributed to the cause of this event, and current Station procedures and guidelines are not sufficiently detailed to ensure workers are not in a knowledge based performance mode when assessing risk just prior to job execution. Individual behaviors, mindset, and knowledge levels, as well as Station procedures and processes need to be at a level to ensure risk identification and mitigation actions are adequately evaluated prior to the job scheduled start time. </P><P>The Station determined that the root cause of the plant trip was that operational risk was not effectively identified or mitigated by individuals throughout the organization. </P><P>NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) </P><P>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150&quot;()104 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 </P><P>(02'2014) Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.</P><P>..~,~,,~'&quot; </P><P>~ .

This procedure provides direction consistent with industry best practices, and requires individual review of each category of risk identification and mitigation. </P><P>SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE </P><P>The loss of stator water cooling pressure caused a turbine trip to protect the main generator as 
designed. Plant safety systems shutdown the reactor plant and support systems operated as 
designed. One non-safety bus was wetted and then deenergized as a precautionary measure. No 
equipment was damaged. The plant trip is considered uncomplicated.
