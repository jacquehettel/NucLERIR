FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -001 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND As a result of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspection conducted from January 1 to June 21, 2010, the NRC determined that Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) did not have adequate procedures to protect the intake structure and auxiliary building against external flooding events. Specifically, contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, the station failed to maintain procedures for combating a significant flood as recommended by Regulatory Guide 1.33, Appendix A, section 6.w, “Acts of Nature.” The NRC identified the following violation of NRC requirements associated with a yellow significance determination process finding in the mitigating systems cornerstone in inspection report 05000285/2010008 dated October 6, 2010: Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, “Procedures,” states, “Written procedures and administrative policies shall be established, implemented, and maintained covering the following activities: (a) The applicable procedures recommended in Regulatory Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A, 1978.” NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, “Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation),” Appendix A, “Typical Procedures for Pressurized Water Reactors and Boiling Water Reactors,” Section 6, recommends procedures for combating emergencies and other significant events. Section 6.w, “Acts of Nature,” includes, in part, procedures for combating floods. Contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, since 1978, written procedures and administrative policies were not maintained covering the applicable procedures recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A. Specifically, the licensee failed to maintain written procedures for combating a significant external flood as recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide, Appendix A, Section 6.w, “Acts of Nature.” The licensee’s written procedures did not adequately prescribe steps to mitigate external flood conditions in the Auxiliary Building and Intake Structure up to 1014 feet mean sea level, as documented in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report [USAR]. The NRC reported that the station’s flood protection strategy was not fully effective during worst-case Missouri River flooding scenarios. The strategy required workers to install floodgates in front of the doors to the plant’s auxiliary building and intake structure, and then stack and drape sandbags over the top of the floodgates up to a height of five feet. The procedural guidance was inadequate because the cross-section on top of the floodgates would not support a stacked sandbag configuration that would retain five feet of moving water. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12102A096_img_2.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2012 -001 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET EVENT DESCRIPTION During an inspection of flood preparations by the NRC in response to NRC findings previously noted, it was determined that the guidance is not adequate to mitigate a design basis flood event (1014 feet mean sea level (msl)). As a result of the procedural inadequacies, the intake structure was vulnerable to water inflow during an extreme flooding event.  This inflow had the potential to affect the operability of both trains of safety related raw water pumps (ultimate heat sink).  As a result the station implemented the actions listed in the corrective actions below. On February 10, 2012, an eight (8) hour report was made under 10 CFR 50.72 (b)(3)(ii)(B) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) at 1754 CST (Event Number (EN) 47658).  After further evaluation this report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and (D). CONCLUSION A root cause determination is in progress.  The results of the evaluation will be published in a revision to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Compensatory actions have been identified and were implemented. 1. The station revised AOP-01, Acts of Nature, Section I – Flood, and Attachment D, Flooding Protective Actions, and the Floating Step Monitoring Index.  Corrections were made to add steps to provide alternate filling capability for maintaining Intake cell level.  2. Changes were also made to Operating Instruction OI-CW-1, “Circulating Water System Normal Operation,” to address deficiencies in controlling the circulating water system during design basis conditions. Additional corrective actions will be made following completion of the cause evaluation. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The Fort Calhoun Station is required to be protected from flooding within the station’s licensing basis.  The safety related equipment required to mitigate the consequences of an accident were affected by these findings.  The openings could have jeopardized the ability of the safety related equipment to perform their design basis function during an accident.  Other methods of removing decay heat and mitigating the consequences of a flooding event were available.  Therefore, this external flooding concern has substantial importance to safety as indicated by the Yellow Finding issued for this event. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
