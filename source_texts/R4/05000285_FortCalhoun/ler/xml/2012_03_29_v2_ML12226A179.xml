   <abstract>While investigating operating experience from another station concerning potential
            instrument drift it was determined that Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is subject to similar
            conditions. It was determined that pressure switches that provide safety related signals
            for high containment pressure to the reactor protection system (RPS) and engineered
            safeguards actuation circuitry may be similarly affected at FCS. The impact of the
            potential drift was evaluated and it was determined that neither RPS nor the engineered
            safeguard circuitry may actuate at the required containment pressure of 5 psig. An
            evaluation determined that the actuation may not occur until slightly higher than the
            required pressure. Other systems are currently being evaluated for this condition. A
            cause analysis was completed. However, internal reviews have identified that additional
            investigation is required to sufficiently characterize this issue. The results of the
            revised cause analysis and corrective actions will be published in a supplement to this
            report.</abstract>
   <narrative>
      <eventDesc>While investigating operating experience from
      another station it was determined that Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is subject to similar
      conditions. The operating experience involved setpoint drift of safety-related pressure
      switches beyond what had been accounted for in the stationâ€™s safety analyses. Engineering
      performed an equipment database search to determine where the switches in question were
      installed at FCS. Several switches that input into specific Reactor Protection System (RPS)
      and Engineered Safeguards Actuation Circuitry (ESF) loops were in the affected population.
      Specifically these pressure switches provide safety-related signals for high containment
      pressure to the RPS and ESF. The impact of the potential drift was evaluated and it was
      determined that neither RPS nor the engineered safeguard circuitry may actuate at the required
      containment pressure of 5 psig. A preliminary evaluation determined that the actuation may
      occur at a slightly higher value than the required pressure. Other systems are currently being
      evaluated for the condition. On May 2, 2012, an eight (8)-hour report was made per 10 CFR
      50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) at 1802 CDT (Event Number
      (EN) 47892) as an unanalyzed condition. This LER is amending the reporting criteria for this
      issue as reported in LER 2012-004-0. This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B),
      10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A,B,C,D).</eventDesc>
