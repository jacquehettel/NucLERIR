In the postulated event, a fire in the CR could cause one of the ammeter wires to short to the ground plane. Simultaneously, if the fire causes another DC wire from the opposite polarity on the same battery to also short to the ground plane, a ground loop would be established through the unprotected ammeter wiring. This event could result in excessive current flow (heating) in the ammeter wiring to the point of causing a secondary fire in the raceway system. The secondary fire could adversely affect safe shutdown equipment and potentially result in the loss of the ability to conduct a safe shutdown as required by 10 CFR50 Appendix R. Plant engineering personnel reviewed the information against station electrical schematics and at approximately 1230 CDT on October 28, 2013, an 8-hour notification was made pursuant to 10 FR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). The station was in Mode 5 when the condition was identified. An hourly fire watch was established in the affected locations of the station.

EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 9,2013, an event notification applicable to Callaway Nuclear Power Plant was posted that documented a postulated fire event regarding the impact of unfused direct current (DC) ammeter circuits in the control room (CR). In the postulated event, a fire in the CR could cause one of the ammeter wires to short to the ground plane. Simultaneously, if the fire causes another DC wire from the opposite polarity on the same battery to also short to the ground plane, a ground loop would be established through the unprotected ammeter wiring. This event could result in excessive current flow (heating) in the ammeter wiring to the pOint of causing a secondary fire in the raceway system. The secondary fire could adversely affect safe shutdown equipment and potentially result in the loss of the ability to conduct a safe shutdown as required by 10 CFR50 Appendix R. Plant engineering personnel reviewed the information against station electrical schematics and at approximately 1230 COT on October 28,2013, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations Office under 10 FR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), any event or condition that results in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety (Event Number 49478). The station was in Mode 5 when the condition was identified. This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii), any event or condition that resulted in: (B) the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. CONCLUSION The short vulnerabilities described in this report have existed since the original design and installation of the DC ammeter circuitry at FCS. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS An hourly fire watch was established in the Control Room, Cable Spreading Room, Switchgear Rooms, and Air Compressor Room as a compensatory action for this postulated fire event. The fire watch will be maintained until completion of Engineering Change (EC) 62826, Add Fuses to the DC Ammeter Circuitry for Ammeters. FCS will install fuses in the DC ammeter circuitry as determined by EC 62826. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE A fire in the Control Room could cause ammeter wires to short to the ground plane. This would cause a ground loop through the unprotected ammeter wiring to the point of causing a secondary fire in the raceway system. The secondary fire could cause the loss of the ability to conduct a safe shutdown as required by 10 CFR 50 Appendix R. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
