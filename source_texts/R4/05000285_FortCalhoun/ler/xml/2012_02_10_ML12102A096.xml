   <abstract>During a review of the station's procedures for responding to external flooding
      conditions, it was determined that the guidance is not adequate to mitigate a design basis
      flood event (1014 feet mean sea level (msl)). A root cause analysis is in progress. Following
      completion of the cause analysis a revision to this LER will be submitted to provide the

   <narrative>
      <background>As a result of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspection conducted from
         January 1 to June 21, 2010, the NRC determined that Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) did not have
         adequate procedures to protect the intake structure and auxiliary building against external
         flooding events. Specifically, contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, the station
         failed to maintain procedures for combating a significant flood as recommended by
         Regulatory Guide 1.33, Appendix A, section 6.w, “Acts of Nature.” The NRC identified the
         following violation of NRC requirements associated with a yellow significance determination
         process finding in the mitigating systems cornerstone in inspection report 05000285/2010008
         dated October 6, 2010: Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, “Procedures,” states, “Written
         procedures and administrative policies shall be established, implemented, and maintained
         covering the following activities: (a) The applicable procedures recommended in Regulatory
         Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A, 1978.” NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, “Quality Assurance
         Program Requirements (Operation),” Appendix A, “Typical Procedures for Pressurized Water
         Reactors and Boiling Water Reactors,” Section 6, recommends procedures for combating
         emergencies and other significant events. Section 6.w, “Acts of Nature,” includes, in part,
         procedures for combating floods. Contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, since 1978,
         written procedures and administrative policies were not maintained covering the applicable
         procedures recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A. Specifically,
         the licensee failed to maintain written procedures for combating a significant external
         flood as recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide, Appendix A, Section 6.w, “Acts of Nature.”
         The licensee’s written procedures did not adequately prescribe steps to mitigate external
         flood conditions in the Auxiliary Building and Intake Structure up to 1014 feet mean sea
         level, as documented in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report [USAR]. The NRC reported
         that the station’s flood protection strategy was not fully effective during worst-case
         Missouri River flooding scenarios. The strategy required workers to install floodgates in
         front of the doors to the plant’s auxiliary building and intake structure, and then stack
         and drape sandbags over the top of the floodgates up to a height of five feet. The
         procedural guidance was inadequate because the cross-section on top of the floodgates would
         not support a stacked sandbag configuration that would retain five feet of moving
         water.</background>
      <eventDesc>During an inspection of flood preparations by the NRC in response to NRC findings
         previously noted, it was determined that the guidance is not adequate to mitigate a design
         basis flood event (1014 feet mean sea level (msl)). As a result of the procedural
         inadequacies, the intake structure was vulnerable to water inflow during an extreme
         flooding event. This inflow had the potential to affect the operability of both trains of
         safety related raw water pumps (ultimate heat sink). As a result the station implemented
         the actions listed in the corrective actions below. On February 10, 2012, an eight (8) hour
         report was made under 10 CFR 50.72 (b)(3)(ii)(B) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office
         (HOO) at 1754 CST (Event Number (EN) 47658). After further evaluation this report is being
         made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and (D). </eventDesc>
      <conclusion>A root cause determination is in progress. The results of the evaluation will be
         published in a revision to this LER.</conclusion>
      <correctiveActions>Compensatory actions have been identified and were implemented. 1. The
         station revised AOP-01, Acts of Nature, Section I – Flood, and Attachment D, Flooding
         Protective Actions, and the Floating Step Monitoring Index. Corrections were made to add
         steps to provide alternate filling capability for maintaining Intake cell level. 2. Changes
         were also made to Operating Instruction OI-CW-1, “Circulating Water System Normal
         Operation,” to address deficiencies in controlling the circulating water system during
         design basis conditions. Additional corrective actions will be made following completion of
         the cause evaluation.</correctiveActions>
      <safetySignificance>The Fort Calhoun Station is required to be protected from flooding within
         the station’s licensing basis. The safety related equipment required to mitigate the
         consequences of an accident were affected by these findings. The openings could have
         jeopardized the ability of the safety related equipment to perform their design basis
         function during an accident. Other methods of removing decay heat and mitigating the
         consequences of a flooding event were available. Therefore, this external flooding concern
         has substantial importance to safety as indicated by the Yellow Finding issued for this
         event.</safetySignificance>
      <safetySystemFunctionalAnalysis>This event does result in a safety system functional failure
         in accordance with NEI-99-02.</safetySystemFunctionalAnalysis>
