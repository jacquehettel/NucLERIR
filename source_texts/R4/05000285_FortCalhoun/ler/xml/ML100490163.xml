This occurred during a surveillance test (ST), when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. In preparation for performing a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoffpiping, a procedural step in the ST opened manual containment isolation valve SI-41O, as well as re-aligning other valves. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 deg F; thus, containment integrity is required. Prior to the subsequent performance of the ST on November I, 2009, it was recognized that the opening of SI-41 0 needed to be administratively controlled. The ST procedure was revised to require administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SI-41O. The root cause analysis for this event is still incomplete; however, the preliminary cause of this event is failure of previous reviewers of the test procedure to identify and resolve the conflict between required test conditions and opening SI-41O. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

(2) The equipment hatch is properly closed and sealed. (3) The personnel air lock satisfies Specification 2.6(l)b. (4) All automatic containment isolation valves are operable, locked closed, or deactivated and secured in their closed position (or isolated by locked closed valves or blind flanges as permitted by a limiting condition for operation). (5)· The uncontrolled containment leakage satisfies Specification 3.5, and (6) The sealing mechanism associated with each penetration (e.g., welds, bellows or O-rings) is operable. TS section 2.6(1 )a, states &quot;Containment integrity shall not be violated unless the reactor is in a cold or refueling shutdown condition. Without containment integrity, it must be restored within one hour or the plant must be in at least hot shutdown within the next six hours, or be subcritical and less than 300 degrees F within the next six hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Normally locked or sealed-closed valves (except for PCV742AIBICID) may be opened intermittently under administrative control without constituting a violation of containment integrity.&quot; EVENT DESCRIPTION Containment integrity was unknowingly violated on October 26, 2003, and November 26, 2006. This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SI-4lO (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve) when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. Prior to November 2009, a step existed in QC-ST -SI-3006, &quot;Safety Injection Leakoff Piping Forty Month Functional Test,&quot; to open manual containment isolation valve SI-410, as well as re-aligning other valves, in preparation for perfonning a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoff piping. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 deg F and containment integrity being required. Prior to the ST being perfoinied on November 1, 2009, it was recognized by a shift manager that the opening ofSI-410 needed to be administratively controlled in order to be in compliance with TS 2.6(1 )a. On November 1,2009, a revision was made to QC-ST-SI-3006. A note, a caution, and a step were added at the beginning of the procedure section to require that a dedicated operator be assigned to close manual containment isolation valve SI-41O (Safety injection Tanks FililDrain Valve) when directed by the control room, to establish containment integrity. Nuclear Safety Review Group (NSRG) and System Engineering (SE) personnel performed a review ofpast performances of QC-ST -SI-3006. The review determined that the station unknowingly entered and subsequently violated TS 2.6(1)a on October 26, 2003 and November 26, 2006 as a result of opening valve SI-41 0 when containment integrity was required and administrative controls (dedicated operator) were not implemented. This issue was identified and documented in Condition Report (CR) 2009-6365. </TH></TR></Table><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U,S.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedure QC-ST -SI-3006 was revised to require that administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SJ-410. The completed rootcause analysis will specify any additional corrective actions to correct the root cause of this event. . SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The safety significance of this event will be determined with the completed root cause analysis. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
