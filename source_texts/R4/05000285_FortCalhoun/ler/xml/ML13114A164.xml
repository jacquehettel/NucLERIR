FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -004 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. Description of the 120-Volt a-c System Description The 120-Volt a-c system consists of four vital uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), each with a bypass regulated transformer; inverter, static switch and manual bypass switches, and a swing inverter. This UPS supplies power to vital instrument buses labeled A, B, C, and D.  The inverters also are called by the same alphabetic letters and have corresponding tag numbers, EE-8H, EE-8J, EE-8K, and EE-8L, respectively.  Swing inverters for the vital instrument buses have tag numbers EE-8T and EE-8U. There is also a non-vital 120-Volt a-c system. It consists of two UPS’s, each with a bypass regulated transformer, inverter, static switch and manual bypass switches, and a swing inverter,  This UPS supplies power to non-vital instrument buses labeled 1 and 2.  The inverters are called 1 and 2, and have tag numbers EE-8P and EE-8Q. During normal operation, UPS A will supply vital AC bus A, UPS B will supply vital bus B, UPS C will supply vital bus C, and UPS D will supply vital bus D.  Loads on the instrument buses will be supplies from the inverters through their static and bypass switches.  In the event that one of the inverters should fail, its static switch will transfer to the “Bypass Source Supplying Load” position and the load will continue to operate uninterrupted. The swing inverter is normally operated in an “off” state.  One swing UPS can power either vital bus A or C while the other swing UPS can power either bus B or D when maintenance is performed on an inverter. When transferring loads between either “A” or “C” UPS, and the swing UPS, proper synchronizing must be maintained between the systems. There is a six year history of Control Room alarms associated with Inverters “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D” when Diesel Generator testing is conducted with Ametek SCI inverters (that replaced the Elgar inverters in 2008). Inverter Trouble alarms and Instrument Bus Low Voltage/ Ground alarms also occur when loads are placed on or removed from various a-c buses. EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 22, 2013, while performing testing of diesel generators in accordance with OP-ST-ESF-0002, the Ametek inverters “A” and “C,” instrument bus “A” and “C” Low Voltage/Ground alarms came in and cleared repeatedly.  A slight smell of smoke was detected by several personnel in the Control Room in the vicinity of AI-40A. The following equipment had failed and/or was damaged: LIC-2802, PIC-2802, A/PIA-102X, C-VOPT and possibly one or more of the CCW HX/RW temperature meters.  This condition/event was entered in to the corrective action program. Fort Calhoun had replaced the original Elgar inverters with new Ametek SCI inverters during the 2008 refueling outage.  After installation continuing intermittent inverter trouble alarms and instrument bus low voltage/ground alarms occurred when loads are placed on or removed from various a-c buses.   A design change completed in April of 2011 removed a ground connection between two capacitors in the inverters. However, testing of the modification was not completed before the 2011 flood and the station did not operate with the modification installed.  A causal analysis is in progress and the results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13114A164_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.
