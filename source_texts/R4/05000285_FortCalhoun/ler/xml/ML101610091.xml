EXPECTED SUBMISSION DA TE) 0 NO SUBMISSION DATE 08 30 2010 ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) Containment integrity was violated on November 1, 2009. This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve S1-410 (Safety injection Tanks Fill/Prain Valve) when containment integrity was required and inadequate administrative controls were implemented. In preparation for perfonning a leak check of the safety injection tanks leakoffpiping, a procedural step in the surveillance test opened manual containment isolation valve SI-4IO, as well as re-aligning other valves. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system to be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 degrees F; thus, containment integrity is required. Prior to the perfonnance of the ST on November 1,2009, it was recognized that the opening ofSI-41O needed to be administratively controlled. The ST procedure was revised to require administrative controls be in place prior to opening containment isolation valve SI-410. The root cause analysis for this event is still incomplete; however, the preliminary cause of this event is failure of previous reviewers of the test procedure to identify and resolve the conflict between required test conditions and opening SI-410.

(2) The equipment hatch is properly closed and sealed. (3) The personnel air lock satisfies Specification 2.6(1)b. (4) All automatic containment isolation valves are operable, locked closed, or deactivated and secured in their closed position (or isolated by locked closed valves or blind flanges as permitted by a limiting condition for operation). (5) The uncontrolled containment leakage satisfies Specification 3.5, and (6) The sealing mechanism associated with each penetration (e.g., welds, bellows or O-rings) is operable. TS section 2.6(I)a, states: &quot;Containment integrity shall not be violated unless the reactor is in a cold or refueling shutdown condition. Without containment integrity, restore containment integrity within one hour or be in at least hot shutdown within the next 6 hours, in at least subcritical and less than 300 degrees F within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Normally locked or sealed-closed valves (except for PCV742AIBICID) may be opened intermittently under administrative control without constituting a violation of containment integrity.&quot; The TS basis provides the following additional information: &quot;The opening oflocked or sealed closed containment isolation valves on an intermittent basis under administrative control includes the following considerations: (1) stationing an operator, who is in constant communication with the control room, at the valve controls, (2) instructing this operator to close these valves in an accident situation, and (3) assuring that environmental conditions will not preclude access to close the valves and that this action will prevent the release ofradioactivity outside the containment.&quot; EVENT DESCRIPTION Containment integrity was violated on November 1, 2009. This was a result of opening manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve) when containment integrity was required and inadequate administrative controls were implemented. Prior to November 1,2009, a step existed in QC-ST-SI-3006, &quot;Safety Injection LeakoffPiping Forty Month Functional Test,&quot; to open manual containment isolation valve SI-410 (Safety Injection Tanks FilllDrain Valve), as well as re-aligning other valves, in preparation for performing a leak check ofthe safety injection tanks leakoff piping. The procedure prerequisites require the reactor coolant system be pressurized above 600 psig, which results in the reactor coolant system being greater than 210 degrees Fahrenheit and containment integrity required. Prior to the ST being performed on November 1,2009, it was recognized by a shift manager that the opening ofSI-4l0 needed to be administratively controlled in order to be in compliance with TS 2.6(l)a. However, this thought was in error since the TS bases prohibit this valve from being opened when the plant is greater than 210 degrees Fahrenheit. </TH></TR></Table><P>NK(; F-URM 366A (9-2007) &quot;'&quot;&quot; t::u UN KI::(;Y(;LI::D PAPER </P><P>, t,', </P><P>.../ </P><P>:&quot; </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

A note, a caution, and a step were added at the beginning of the procedure section to require that an operator be assigned to close manual containment isolation valve SI-4lO when directed by the control room, to establish containment integrity. However, environmental conditions during an accident could preclude an operator from shutting SI-410 during an accident. An extent of condition review from LER 2009-004 noted the violation of the TS basis information. The review determined that the station entered and subsequently violated TS 2.6(1)a on November 1,2009, as a result of opening valve SI-410 when containment integrity was required. This issue was identified and documented in Condition Report (CR) 2010-1664. This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). CONCLUSION A root cause analysis is in progress and the results will be included in an update to the LER. CORRECTNE ACTIONS The completed root cause analysis will specify corrective actions to correct the root cause of this event. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The safety significance of this event will be determined with the completed root cause analysis. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does not result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
