PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -010 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION While preparing an engineering package to relocate two transmitters, Fort Calhoun Station engineering identified seismic class 1 components in a seismic class 2 instrument rack.  This appears to be a legacy issue.  The instrument racks in the auxiliary building and containment were assessed with respect to the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) specified class 1 requirements for seismic design. The seismic calculations for two instrument racks were over the analyzed weight for the seismic analysis. The instruments on these racks are used for reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure transmitters. During a seismic event, the excessive weight of these instrument racks could cause the racks to fail, resulting in an unisolable leak from the RCS. At 2059 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on June 4, 2012, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations office (HOO), under 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), degraded condition.  Subsequent internal review has determined that the initial reporting criterion for degraded condition, 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), was incorrect.  The 8-hour non-emergency notification should have been made under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), unanalyzed condition.  On August 3, 2012, Event Notification (EN) 47992 was updated to correct the reporting criterion.  This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B). This LER reports a condition where components classified as seismic class 1 were installed in instrument racks classified as seismic class 2, specifically RCS pressure transmitters that are part of the RCS pressure boundary.  A failure of these racks during a seismic event could result in an unisolable RCS leak.  The condition was documented in the FCS corrective action system on December 6, 2011.  The initial Operations review focused on the current operating conditions, noting that the condition would need to be resolved prior to start up.  The station paradigm inappropriately concluded that reportability could be evaluated at a later date since current operating conditions were not challenged, and that the 60-day reporting window commenced when the event was determined to be reportable. This condition was initially reported in Event Notification (EN) 47992 on June 4, 2012, at 2059 CDT. FCS has been systematically addressing issues that have been identified since June 2011, in response to the flooding conditions, switchgear fire, and increased oversight.  This LER is being submitted beyond the 60-day regulatory reporting requirement due to non-conservative decisions with respect to procedural and regulatory reportability requirements and resource constraints caused by the operating challenges which began in June 2011. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12219A010_img_1.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.
