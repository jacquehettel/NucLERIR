At the time of discovery, FC03901 indicated that VA-15A/B required cross-bracing, which was added and the equipment was considered operable. Since VA-16A/B was overstressed, they were considered inoperable. During an inspection, the NRC questioned the operability determination provided in CR 2013-02260 for VA-15A/B and VA-16A/B due to the seismic criteria not being met. The station responded that since the cross-bracing had been added to VA-15A/B, they were considered operable. However, VA-16A/B did not meet the current licensing basis and they were considered inoperable. On April 6, 2013, CR 201307674 was initiated and a reportability evaluation determined that the condition was reportable. The unit was defueled when the condition was identified.

PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 2 2013 -007 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION Condition Report (CR) 2013-02260 identified that a summary structural analysis (FC03901) indicated that VA-15A/B (Containment Cooler/Filter Unit A/B plenum was overstressed by 100 percent and that VA-16A/B (Containment Air Cooling Unit A/B plenum) was also overstressed.  At the time of discovery, FC03901 indicated that VA-15A/B required cross-bracing, which was added and the equipment was considered operable. Since VA-16A/B was only slightly overstressed, it was also considered operable. During an inspection, the NRC questioned the operability determination provided in CR 2013-02260 for VA-15A/B and VA-16A/B due to the seismic criteria not being met.  The station responded that since the cross-bracing had been added to VA-15A/B, they were considered operable.  However, VA-16A/B did not meet the current licensing basis and were considered inoperable.  On April 6, 2013, CR 2013-07674 was initiated and a reportability evaluation determined that the condition was reportable.  The unit was defueled when the condition was identified. This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant’s Technical Specifications. A causal analysis is in progress, the results of which will be published in a supplement to this LER. CONCLUSION A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE A causal analysis is in progress.  The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER. PREVIOUS EVENTS A causal analysis is in progress.
