Specifically, contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, the station failed to maintain procedures for combating a significant flood as recommended by Regulatory Guide 1.33, Appendix A, section 6.w, &quot;Acts of Nature.&quot; The NRC identified the following violation of NRC requirements associated with a yellow significance determination process finding in the mitigating systems cornerstone in inspection report 05000285/2010008 dated October 6, 2010: Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, &quot;Procedures,&quot; states, 'Written procedures and administrative policies shall be established, implemented, and maintained covering the following activities: (a) The applicable procedures recommended in Regulatory Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A, 1978.&quot; NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, &quot;Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation},&quot; Appendix A, ''Typical Procedures for Pressurized Water Reactors and Boiling Water Reactors,&quot; Section 6, recommends procedures for combating emergencies and other significant events. Section 6.w, &quot;Acts of Nature,&quot; includes, in part, procedures for combating floods. Contrary to Technical Specification 5.8.1.a, since 1978, written procedures and administrative policies were not maintained covering the applicable procedures recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide 1.33, Revision 2, Appendix A. Specifically, the licensee failed to maintain written procedures for combating a significant external flood as recommended by NRC Regulatory Guide, Appendix A, Section 6.w, &quot;Acts of Nature.&quot; The licensee's written procedures did not adequately prescribe steps to mitigate external flood conditions in the Auxiliary Building and Intake Structure up to 1014 feet mean sea level, as documented in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report [USAR]. The NRC reported that the station's flood protection strategy was not fully effective during worst-case Missouri River flooding scenarios. The strategy required workers to install floodgates in front of the doors to the plant's auxiliary building and intake structure, and then stack and drape sandbags over the top of the floodgates up to a height of five feet. The procedural guidance was inadequate because the cross-section on top of the floodgates would not support a stacked sandbag configuration that would retain -five feet of moving water. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

These penetrations were installed during the installation of the original plant security system and were abandoned when the security system was replaced (approximately 1985). The penetrations for the &quot;new&quot; security system were appropriately sealed. The old penetrations were abandoned and not sealed. As a result of the penetrations not being sealed, the intake structure was vulnerable to water inflow during an extreme flooding event. This inflow had the potential to affect the operability of both trains of safety related raw water pumps (ultimate heat sink). On February 27,2011, an eight (8) hour report was made under 10 CFR 50.72 (b)(3)(v)(D) to the NRC Headquarters Operation Office (HOO) at 1623 CST. The report should have been made on January 27,2011. This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). CONCLUSION A root cause determination was prepared in connection with CR 2010-2387 which documents the causes of the problem. The following four (4) root causes explain why written procedures were inadequate to mitigate the external flood conditions prescribed by the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR). These root causes address the NRC issued yellow finding as well as the specific penetration being addressed in this LER. • Historically, when procedures for flooding protection were restructured or substantially augmented, a weak procedure revision process did not assure FCS met its USAR requirements. • Supervisory and management oversight of work activities associated with external flood matters was not sufficient to prevent this issue from occurring. • The FCS organization has not been effective in ensuring that performance deficiencies related to external flooding are adequately identified, evaluated, and resolved. • Mindsets existed that FCS was safe &quot;as-is&quot; relative to external flooding events. These mindsets collectively led to the incorrect conclusion that regulatory requirements were being met. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The penetrations were temporarily sealed. A configuration change was developed and permanent seals were installed in the subject conduits. Comprehensive corrective actions to address the root and contributing causes are being developed and will be addressed through the corrective action program. Additional corrective actions will be identified in a revision to this LEA. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

The station raw water pumps, which are part of the ultimate heat sink, are located in the intake structure. The openings could have jeopardized the ability of the raw water pumps to perform their design basis function during an accident. Another method of removing decay heat is available. However, FCS recognizes that external flooding has substantial importance to safety. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS This issue was identified in NRC inspection report 05000285/2010008 dated October 6, 2010. During the extent of cause analysis for the issue these penetrations were identified. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
