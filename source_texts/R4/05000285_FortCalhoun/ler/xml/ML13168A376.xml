PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -009 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station was licensed prior to the General Design Criteria and Standard Review Plan. The station was designed in accordance with the 70 draft General Design Criteria published for comment in the Federal Register (32 FR 10213) on July 11, 1967. Criterion 2 of the 70 draft General Design Criteria, which discusses tornadoes and appears in the FCS USAR, is provided below. CRITERION 2 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS Those systems and components of reactor facilities which are essential to the prevention of accidents which could affect public health and safety or to mitigation of their consequences shall be designed, fabricated, and erected to performance standards that will enable the facility to withstand, without loss of the capability to protect the public, the additional forces that might be imposed by natural phenomena such as earthquakes, tornadoes, flooding conditions, winds, ice and other local site effects. The design bases so established shall reflect: (a) Appropriate consideration for the most severe of these natural phenomena that have been recorded for the site and the surrounding area and (b) an appropriate margin for withstanding forces greater than those recorded to reflect uncertainties about the historical data and their suitability as a basis for design. EVENT DESCRIPTION While performing an extent of condition review for the condition identified in LER 2013-005-0, Control Room HVAC Modification Did Not Properly Address Safety Consequences, additional tornado missile vulnerabilities were identified. These currently include: Intake Structure Removable Hatches for the Raw Water Pumps Room 81 Roof Openings Auxiliary Feedwater Steam Driven Pump Exhaust Stack, FW-10 Diesel Fuel Oil Tanks Vent Stack and Fill Line, FO-1/FO-10 Raw Water Pump Cable Pull Boxes Diesel Generator Exhaust Stacks, DG-1/DG-2 These additional interactions do not appear to be a result of plant modifications, as was the case with the control room air handlers. The station is currently performing reviews of previously identified interactions with additional plant walkdowns to determine the scope and resolutions to mitigate any identified interactions. At the time of discovery, the unit was shutdown with fuel removed. This report is being submitted pursuant to; 1. 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v): any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to (A) shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) remove residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; or (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, and </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13168A376_img_3.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2013 -009 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET 2. 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B): any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. CONCLUSION As discussed above, these additional interactions do not appear to be a result of plant modifications as was the case with the control room air handlers. These additional interactions appear to have existed since initial licensing. Some of the interactions had inappropriately been considered acceptable using probabilistic analysis. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The station is performing extent of condition reviews associated with LER 2013-005-0. The station will determine the scope and resolutions to mitigate the currently identified interactions as well as any additional interactions prior to plant restart. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE During a tornado strike, it is expected that one or more pieces of equipment identified during the extent of condition required for safe shutdown, mitigation of the consequences of an accident, control the release of radioactive material, or remove residual heat may become unavailable. The duration of the event (tornado strike) would be of a short duration. However, the duration of the resulting conditions would be expected to persist from a few hours to several days. Redundancy of equipment, such as a third diesel engine driven auxiliary feedwater pump, broadens the mitigation responses available. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with Nuclear Energy institute, NEI-99-02, Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline, Revision 6. PREVIOUS EVENTS One previous event, LER 2013-005, was identified. It was the extent of condition from the event identified in LER 2013-005 that lead to the current LER. The conditions identified in the current LER are legacy issues that could not have been prevented or corrected by the actions taken or planned in LER 2013-005. </Figure></TaggedPDF-doc>
