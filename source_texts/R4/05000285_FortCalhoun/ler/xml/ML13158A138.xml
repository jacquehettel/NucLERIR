PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2013 -008 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 11, 2013, the test results of seven General Electric (GE) IAV relays indicated that three safety-related, seismically qualified, relays did not pass IEEE 344, IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic Qualification of Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, testing. The condition was entered in to the Station's corrective action program. These relays were originally purchased seismically qualified and installed in 1973.  While inspecting the failed relays, it was noted that they were missing a control spring support wire, although the relays did contain the mounting screws for the support wire.  The support wire has been part of the standard IAV relay design for over 30 years.  The support wire prevents the control spring from sagging. The station reviewed the procedures used to calibrate the relays, reviewed the original procurement specifications, and reviewed historical modifications to determine if the station did anything that would have removed the support wire.  After the review, the station concluded that the relays were most likely supplied without the support wire during the original construction of the plant. This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v); Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.” CONCLUSION A causal analysis determined that the failure was caused by a control spring in the relay contacting either the disk or the drag magnet during seismic testing resulting in a short. A wire used to support the control spring was not installed in the relays that failed the testing allowing the spring to sag and make electrical contact. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS There are a total of 45 GE IAV relays identified in the plant, of which 32 are safety-related.  Twelve of these had previously been replaced and two more were verified to have the support wire installed.  The remaining 18 relays will be inspected, and if the support wire is missing, they will be replaced prior to plant startup. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The safety significance of the three failed relays can be characterized as follows: </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13158A138_img_3.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 3 OF 3 2013 -008 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET In the case of relay 27-1/1A3, a ground alarm would be received and the under voltage circuit would be inoperable.  This would have prevented the load shedding of safeguard loads and non-safeguards loads.  Diesel generator DG-1 would not have started. In the case of relay 27-1/1A3-13, a ground alarm would be received and under voltage circuit would be inoperable.  This would cause relays 27T1X/1A3-13 and 27T2X/1A3-13 not to energize to perform their tripping functions. In the case of relay 27-1/1B4B, an internal short in the relay causes a ground condition. The 125VDC circuit is an ungrounded system, the ground will cause an alarm but the fuse should not open.  A ground alarm would be received on the 125VDC system. This impacts vacuum deaerator circulating pump, DW-46B and indication. The 1B4B circuit would be inoperable and breaker 1B4B-8 for DW-46B would be prevented from tripping on a low voltage condition. Cumulatively, the seismic event would have impacted relays on both the 1A3 and 1A4 buses preventing load shedding functions as well as the starting of diesel generators DG-1 and DG-2. SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02. PREVIOUS EVENTS None </Figure></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
