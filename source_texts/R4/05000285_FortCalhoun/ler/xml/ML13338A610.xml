The seismic test results stated that the GE HFA relays passed the seismic testing, but the relays required two back plate mounting screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds.

Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 2 OF 2013 001 1 </P><P>NARRATIVE </P><P>BACKGROUND </P><P>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. </P><P>EVENT DESCRIPTION </P><P>On January 15, 2013, while reviewing a previous condition report, it was identified that the initial operability determination (OD) completed for General Electric (GE) model HFA relays was incorrect in that it did not appear to fully address the condition of the back plate mounting screws that required torqueing. The seismic test results stated that the GE HFA relays passed the seismic testing, but the relays required two back plate mounting screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds. The condition of the additional required torqueing was initially entered into the corrective action program on December 21, 2012. </P><P>At approximately 2355 Central Standard Time (CST) on February 27,2013, an 8-hour notification </P><P>(EN 48787) was made to the Headquarters Operations office (HOO), under </P><P>1 OCFR50. 72(b)(3)(ii)(B), unanalyzed condition, reporting this event. During the notification, the </P><P>event date identified was incorrectly stated as February 26, 2013. This is the date that the initial </P><P>operability determination was called into question. The correct event date is December 21,2012. </P><P>This is the date which OPPD acknowledged, but misinterpreted, that the vendor identified the GE </P><P>HFAs relays did pass the seismic testing, but the relays required two screws to be torqued to 5 foot</P><P>pounds to pass the testing. </P><P>This report is being submitted in accordance with 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B): any event or condition that </P><P>resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded </P><P>plant safety. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>Extent of condition reviews identified approximately 136 relays that provide various indication and </P><P>control functions in systems such as high pressure safety injection, charging, containment </P><P>ventilation, and the emergency diesel generator, were potentially affected. Sixty-three of the relays </P><P>were identified as not having been replaced since initial operations began. The 63 relays have </P><P>been replaced and the two back plate mounting screws have been torque checked on all the HFA </P><P>relays. It is estimated that over 50 percent of the relays were found to have back plate mounting </P><P>screws torqued to less than 5 foot-pounds. These were torqued to 5 foot-pounds. </P><P>An investigation found that poor communication (both in writing of technical documents and in </P><P>interfacing between individuals) was the cause of not identifying the need for the two back plate </P><P>mounting screws to be torqued to 5 foot-pounds when first reported by the vendor. </P><P>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS </P><P>Replacementltorqueing of the affected relays has been completed. Corrective actions have been </P><P>put in place to: </P><P>1. 	Develop and provide management expectations via a case study to all Design Engineering (DEN) personnel on the miscommunications identified with this event, including failure to validate assumptions. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Important safety </P><P>functions, such as safety injection and load shedding may not have functioned as designed if the </P><P>condition was not identified and repairs completed. </P><P>The investigation identified that there were two relays at zero foot-pounds torque on the back plate mounting screws. As a result, it cannot be assured that these relays would have been able to perform their design function in the case of a seismic event and 30-day mission. The following 2 system functions were affected by these two relays: </P><P>86AX1/SGIS Relay: steam generator isolation signal (SGIS) initiation which closes valves to isolate steam flow and feedwater flow to reduce an uncontrolled steam generator cooldown. </P><P>63XA1LC-101-2 Relay: in response to the second low pressurizer level signal (3.3% below </P><P>programmed level), a signal is produced which starts all 3 charging pumps. </P><P>SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE </P><P>This does not represent a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI 99-02, Revision 6. </P><P>PREVIOUS EVENTS </P><P>None </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
