The current analysis of record establishes that containment temperatures remain above the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) peak temperature for substantially longer (220 seconds versus 60 seconds) but at a lower temperature (347.9 degrees Fahrenheit vs. 401 degrees Fahrenheit). The longer dwell times could result in a more adverse impact on environmentally qualified equipment. A cause analysis is being processed and the results will be reported in a supplement to this LER. Fort Calhoun Station will perform thermal lag analyses for the Electrical Equipment Qualification Program equipment located within containment prior to plant startup.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. 2 OF 3 2012 -009 -0 NARRATIVE LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET BACKGROUND Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) design. EVENT DESCRIPTION FCS Condition Report (CR) 2011-10129, described a condition where equipment within the 10CFR50.49 (Equipment Qualification Rule) was not analyzed to the conditions defined in FCS calculation FC07054 Rev 1, “Containment Response Study of a Main Steam Line Break with GOTHIC,” and created an unanalyzed condition. This condition was determined to be reportable as an unanalyzed condition which could prevent fulfillment of a safety function. During the review of the current analysis of record for Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) inside containment, no analysis or evaluation could be found to address why the original Electrical Environmental Qualification (EEQ) evaluation of peak MSLB conditions remain valid.  The current analysis of record in calculation FC07054 Rev 1 establishes that containment temperatures remain above the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) peak temperature for substantially longer (220 seconds versus 60 seconds) but at a lower temperature (347.9 degrees Fahrenheit vs. 401 degrees Fahrenheit).  The longer dwell time could result in a more adverse impact on environmentally qualified equipment. This would impact both trains and a majority of the safety related equipment inside containment. At 1513 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on May 4, 2012, an 8-hour notification was made to the Headquarters Operations office (HOO), under 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B).  This report is being made per 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A), (B), (C) and (D). This LER reports a condition where equipment within 10 CFR 50.49, Equipment Qualification Rule, was not properly analyzed when the analysis of record was revised.  The initial Operations review focused on the current operating conditions, noting that the condition would need to be resolved prior to start up.  The station paradigm inappropriately concluded that reportability could be evaluated at a later date since current operating conditions were not challenged, and that the 60-day reporting window commenced when the event was determined to be reportable.  In addition, FCS resources were focused on flood response and mitigation due to the extensive flooding that occurred along the Missouri River beginning in June 2011.  FCS had declared an Unusual Event on June 6, 2011, due to rising river level and river projections, and resources were focused on flood response and asset protection.  This condition was initially reported in Event Notification (EN) 47900 on May 4, 2012, at 1513 CDT.  FCS has been systematically addressing issues that have been identified since June 2011, in response to the flooding conditions, switchgear fire, and increased oversight.  This LER is being submitted beyond the 60-day regulatory reporting requirement due to non-conservative decisions with respect to procedural and regulatory reportability requirements and resource constraints caused by the operating challenges which began in June 2011. CONCLUSION A cause analysis is being processed and the results will be reported in a supplement to this LER. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Fort Calhoun Station will perform thermal lag analyses for the Electrical Equipment Qualification Program equipment located within containment prior to plant startup. The LER will be supplemented with the information from the EEQ and cause analysis. Additional actions will be tracked in the stations corrective action system. </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12206A056_img_2.jpg"/>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) 1.

SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
