As a precautionary measure, plant operators used the abnormal operating procedures to align necessary plant equipment to alternate (emergency) power supplies. Emergency Diesel Generator (DG)-2 was manually started to remove bus 1A4 from offsite power. Diesel Generator (DG)-1 was manually started to remove bus 1A3 from offsite power as well. Both Emergency Diesel Generators loaded on their respective busses as designed. Offsite power remained available throughout the event. No safety-related equipment was impacted by the water intrusion. Plant equipment was realigned to the off-site power operating configuration and the emergency diesel generators were secured. FCS was also in a Notification of Unusual Event (NOUE), since June 6, 2011, due to high Missouri river level. River level at the time of this event was 1006 feet 6 inches mean sea level. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The plant has two Fairbanks Morris emergency diesel generators. An AquaDam® is a stable water barrier used to contain, divert, and control the flow of water.  The design consists of two polyethylene liners contained by a single woven outer tube.  When the two inner tubes are filled with water, the resulting pressure and mass create a stable, non-rolling wall of water.  AquaDam® is a registered trademark of Aqua Dam, Inc.  The AquaDam® was installed as an enhancement to the existing station flood control measures. The AquaDam® added a third layer of protection and helped keep the protected area free from flood waters. EVENT DESCRIPTION On June 26, 2011, at approximately 0125 CDT, the AquaDam® providing enhanced flood protection for Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) failed. FCS was shutdown in Mode 5. FCS was in a Notification of Unusual Event (NOUE) due to high Missouri river level since June 6, 2011. A maintenance crew leader was conducting clean-up activities within the protected area, using a skid loader. The skid loader inadvertently contacted and punctured the AquaDam®, and caused its failure. FCS had previously entered AOP-1, Acts of Nature, on May 22, 2011, due to high Missouri river level.  In anticipation of a potential loss of off-site power as a result of wetting the station T1 (345 Kilovolt (KV)/22KV) and T1A-3 and T1A-4 (161KV/4.16KV) transformers, Operations followed procedural guidance of AOP-1 to manually start and load the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG).  At 0221, DG2 was manually started per plant procedure; and at 0250, DG-1 was manually started.  Both EDGs were loaded on their respective busses as designed.  No safety-related equipment was impacted by the water. After it was concluded that there was no challenge to the station transformers and off-site power availability, DG-2 was secured at 1252 and DG-1 was secured at 1408.  Offsite power, supplied by the 345KV and 161KV transmission lines, remained available throughout the event. All safety-related flood protection barriers remained in place during the event. At 0658 CDT, June 26, 2011, the NRC Headquarters Operations Office (HOO) was notified (Event Report 46988) per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This report is being made per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). CONCLUSION This event was initiated by poor Human Performance and Decision Making.  The AquaDam® failure caused Operations to take precautionary measures in accordance with AOP-1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FCS plant systems were returned to the appropriate configuration for the existing plant status. No additional corrective actions are required to address the EDG manual actuations. The enhanced flood protection barrier was replaced. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Adequate procedure guidance existed to allow FCS to take precautionary actions to maintain power to necessary plant equipment.  The AquaDam® was installed as enhanced flood protection and asset management; all safety-related flood protection barriers remained in place during the event.
