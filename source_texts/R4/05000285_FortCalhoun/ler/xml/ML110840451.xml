On January 6, 2010, F0-37 was rendered inoperable due to local area flooding caused by the rupture of FP-772, &quot;Service Building IFire Sprinkler Isolation Valve&quot;. A function of FO-37 is to transfer diesel fuel between &quot;Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks&quot; FO-IO and FO-I. On June 24, 2010, an engineering evaluation detennined that the credited portable back up pump to F0-37 was not the correct pump for the application and would not transfer diesel fuel oil from FO-I 0 to FO-I as intended. Since both pumps (FO-37 and the credited portable back-up pump) were inoperable this is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). A root cause analysis determined there was a failure to perform an appropriate design change evaluation for maintaining diesel fuel oil transfer system capability as required by Technical Specification Amendment 162, dated March 29, 1994. The originally credited portable back-up pump was replaced with a new portable pump that has the capability to transfer diesel fuel oil between tanks FO-I 0 and FO-I. The appropriate procedures were revised to address the pump replacement. </Figure><P>NRC FORM 366 (9·2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9,2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The revised TS 2.7(1 )m, &quot;Limiting Condition for Operation, Electrical Systems, Applicability, Minimum Requirements (plant greater than 300 degrees F&gt;&quot; states, ''One diesel fuel oil storage system containing a minimum volume of 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel in FO-I and a minimum volume of 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel in FO-IO.&quot; The FCS diesel fuel oil system is defined in part as, FO-I, FO-I 0, FO-37, the credited portable back-up pump, associated piping, other pumps, valves, portable hoses and instrumentation. The original licensed configuration was to solely use the fuel oil inventory in FO-I, which contains approximately four days supply for the emergency diesel generators. The TS amendment changes included combining the fuel oil inventories of FO-I and FO-IO, &quot;Auxiliary Boiler (AS-I) Fuel Oil Tank&quot; which would extend the operation of the emergency diesel generators to seven days. FO-I and FO-IO are separate tanks and are not physically connected. The TS amendment 162 ''Discussion, Justification and No Significant Hazards Consideration&quot; section stated that fuel oil make-up to FO-I could be achieved by manually connecting F0-37 from FO-I 0 to FO-I through rubber hose connections. Additionally, a portable pump and hoses were dedicated and stored in an appropriate place as a back-up to F0-37. A preventative maintenance task was developed to periodically verify the pump and hoses are available for use. Since the portable pump is a credited back-up to FO-37, then FO-37 can be out-of-service without violating the TS requirement of having an operable &quot;fuel oil storage system.&quot; FO-37 is a non-Critical Quality Element (CQE) positive displacement pump capable of transferring fuel oil from FO-IO to FOI, through rubber hose connections, at a rate of 5.8 gpm. The credited portable back-up pump was a non-CQE manual double diaphragm Munster Simms Whale Gusher 30 bilge pump with a nominal rating of 29 gpm. FCS Procedure EPIP-RR-17A, ''TSC Administrative Logistics Coordinator Actions&quot; contains instructions on the use of FO-37 and the portable back-up pump to transfer diesel fuel from FO-IO to FO-I. This procedure also addresses the contingency to have diesel fuel oil delivered via truck from a local vendor. This helps to ensure that there is sufficient diesel fuel oil on site should an accident requiring sustained emergency diesel generator operation. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 6-7, 2010, due to local area flooding FO-37 was rendered inoperable for approximately 24 hours. In response to NRC Resident Inspector questions an engineering review was performed on June 24, 2010, on the capability of the portable back-up pump. This review revealed that the portable back-up pump was not the correct pump for the application and it could I not perform the function of transferring diesel fuel oil from FO-I 0 to FO-I in the event that FO-37 was inoperable. Additionally, on August 30, 2010, the portable back-up pump failed a functional test when the pump diaphragm ruptured. Since FO-37 was inoperable on January 6-7, 2010, and an engineering evaluation determined the portable back-up pump was not capable of transferring diesel fuel oil from FO-I 0 to FO-I, then these two components, that are part of the diesel fuel oil system required by TS 2.7(1) m were inoperable concurrently, then this condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 73(a)(2)(i)(B). </TH></TR></Table><P>NH~ I&quot;UHM allll. 11,..loo{) t&quot;HIN I ~uUN ••~~ .~~~... t&quot;At&quot;~t1 </P><P>NRC FORM 366A u.s.
