Fort Calhoun Station 05000285 2 OF 2013 -008 -1 </P><P>NARRATIVE </P><P>BACKGROUND </P><P>Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) is a two-loop reactor coolant system of Combustion Engineering (CE) 
design. 
</P><P>EVENT DESCRI PTION </P><P>On April 11 ,2013, the test results of seven General Electric (GE) IVA relays, indicated that three safety-related, seismically qualified, relays did not pass IEEE 344, IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic Qualification of Class 1 E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, testing. The condition was entered in to the Station's corrective action program. </P><P>These relays we originally purchased seismically qualified and installed in 1978. From inspecting 
the failed relays, it was noted that they were missing a control spring support wire although the 
relays did contain the mounting screws for the support wire. The support wire has been part of 
the standard IAV relay design for over 30 years. The support wire prevents the control spring 
from sagging. 
</P><P>The station reviewed the procedures used to calibrate the relays, reviewed the original 
procurement specifications, and reviewed historical modifications to determine if the station did 
anything that would have removed the support wire. After the review, the station concluded that 
the relays were most likely purchased without the support wire during the original construction of 
the plant. 
</P><P>This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v); any event or condition </P><P>that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are </P><P>needed to: (A) shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) remove </P><P>residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; or (D) mitigate the consequences </P><P>of an accident, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) any operation or condition which was prohibited by the </P><P>plant's Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii) any event where a Single cause or </P><P>condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple </P><P>systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system </P><P>designed to: (A) shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) remove </P><P>residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; or (D) mitigate the consequences </P><P>of an accident, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A) any event or condition that as a result of a single </P><P>cause could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function for two or more trains or channels </P><P>in differ~nt systems that are needed to: (1) shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe </P><P>shutdown condition; (2) remove residual heat; (3) control the release of radioactive material; or </P><P>(4) mitigate the consequences of an accident. </P><P>CONCLUSION </P><P>A causal analysis determined that the failure was caused by a control spring in the relay contacting either the disk or the drag magnet during seismic testing resulting in a short. A wire used to support the control spring was not installed in the relays that failed the testing allowing the spring to sag and make electrical contact. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Twenty-seven of the relays required replacement due to missing the support wire. See Table 1 for a list of relays. </P><P>SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE </P><P>The safety significance of the three failed relays can be characterized as follows: </P><P>In the case of relay 27-1/1A3, a ground alarm would be received and the under voltage circuit would be inoperable. This would have prevented the load shedding of safeguard loads and non-safeguards loads. Diesel generator (DG) 1 would not have started. As part of the follow-up replacement activity, relay 27-2/1A3 was required to be replaced. This would have prevented DG 2 from starting. </P><P>In the case of relay 27-1/1A3-13, a ground alarm would be received and under voltage circuit </P><P>would be inoperable. This would cause relays 27T1 Xl1 A3-13 and 27T2X11 A3-13 not to </P><P>energize to perform their tripping functions. </P><P>In the case of relay 27-1/1 B4B, an internal short in the relay causes a ground condition. The 125VDC circuit is an ungrounded system, the ground will cause an alarm but the fuse FUl10 should not open. A ground alarm would be received on the 125VDC system. This impacts vacuum deaerator circulating pump, DW-46B and indication. The 1 B4B circuit would be inoperable and breaker 1 B4B-8 for DW-46B would be prevented from tripping on a low voltage condition. </P><P>Cumulatively, the seismic event would have impacted relays on both the 1A3 and 1A4 buses preventing load shedding functions as well as the starting of diesel generators DG-1 and DG-2. </P><P>SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE 
This event does result in a safety system functional failure in accordance with NEI-99-02.
