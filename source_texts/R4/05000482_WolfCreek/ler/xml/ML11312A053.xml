The peak-to-peak oscillations in kW output observed in the Control Room were 300 to 400 kW. The &quot;A&quot; DG was declared inoperable at 1443 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on September 1, 2011. The cause of the oscillations was due to an adjustment made to the &quot;A&quot; DG governor in May 2011. The governor was restored to its previous adjustment and the &quot;A&quot; DG was returned to service at 1032 CDT on September 4, 2011. The &quot;8&quot; DG and both offsite circuits were operable while the &quot;A&quot; DG was inoperable from 1443 CDT on September 1, 2011 through 1032 CDT on September 4, 2011.

PAGE 2 OF No inoperable structures, components or systems, other than the &quot;A&quot; Diesel Generator (DG) [EllS Codes: EK, DG], contributed to this event on September 1-4, 2011. The &quot;B&quot; DG [EllS Codes: EK, DG] was also inoperable for approximately three days between May 21, 2011 and September 4, 2011, as shown in the Basis for Reportability. DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On September 1, 2011, procedure STS KJ-005A, &quot;Manual/Auto Start, Sync and Loading of EDG NE01 ,&quot; was conducted for the &quot;A&quot; train diesel generator (DG) to demonstrate operability. When the 5 DG was fully loaded at approximately 5.9 megawatts (MW), oscillations occurred in kilowatt (kW) output, current output and fuel racks position. The peak-to-peak oscillations on kW output were 300 to 400 kW. The operating crew declared the &quot;A&quot; DG inoperable at 1443 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on September 1, 2011. Further evaluation of the issue determined that the oscillations were normal at low loads and would increase when load reached or exceeded 5.8 MW. On August 2, 2011, procedure STS KJ-005A was revised to specify a control band of 5800 kW to 6201 kW. During the performance of STS KJ-005A on September 1, 2011, the excessive oscillations were of sufficient size that the control band criteria could not be met and resulted in declaring the DG inoperable. In response to the oscillations, the &quot;A&quot; DG fuel racks were lubricated and exercised, the electronic governor droop settings and digital reference unit settings were adjusted, and the hydraulic governor actuator was replaced. These actions did not substantially improve the oscillations on the &quot;A&quot; DG. Diagnostic testing tools for the electronic governor did not identify anything unusual. During Refueling Outage 18 in May 2011, Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation employees with assistance from the DG vendor adjusted the &quot;A&quot; DG governor [EllS Code: EK, 65] to reduce fuel rack movement at steady load. This adjustment was determined to be the cause of the oscillations observed on September 1, 2011. The rack movement being experienced prior to May 2011 did not cause oscillations in the generator output. The &quot;A&quot; DG may have been inoperable from approximately 1300 CDT on May 21, 2011, when adjustments to the &quot;A&quot; DG governor were completed. Procedure STS KJ-001A, &quot;ESFAS Testing,&quot; was successfully completed prior to entering Mode 4 on May 24, 2011. &quot;ESFAS&quot; means Engineered Safety Features Actuation System. The &quot;A&quot; DG successfully passed the monthly surveillance test four times between the May 2011 adjustment of the DG governor and the oscillation event on September 1, 2011. In each of the four surveillances, the DG was brought to near full load. Review of the data from these surveillances showed that the oscillations occurred but were not identified as excessive. An evaluation is in progress to determine whether the &quot;A&quot; DG was capable of performing its specified safety function during the period of 1300 COT on May 21, 2011 through 1032 COT on September 4, 2011. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><P>,

A review of previous operational data confirmed that the &quot;8&quot; DG was not affected by load oscillations as a result of the adjustments made to the governor in May 2011. The DGs are Colt-Pielstick I Fairbanks-Morse model 14PC2.5 engines. DGs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;8&quot; are dedicated to Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) buses N801 and N802 [EllS Codes: E8, 8U], respectively. The DGs start automatically on a safety injection signal or on an ESF bus undervoltage signal. In the event of a loss of preferred power, the ESF electrical loads are automatically connected to the DGs in sufficient time to provide for safe reactor shutdown and to mitigate the consequences of a Design 8asis Accident, such as a loss of coolant accident. 8ASIS FOR REPORTA81L1TY The &quot;A&quot; DG may have been inoperable from approximately 1300 COT on May 21, 2011 to 1032 COT on September 4, 2011 because the DG governor was inadequately adjusted. An evaluation is in progress to determine whether the &quot;A&quot; DG was capable of performing its specified safety function during the period of 1300 COT on May 21, 2011 through 1032 COT on September 4, 2011. During this time period, the &quot;8&quot; DG was also inoperable as shown below: Out of Service 06/15/2011, 1146 COT 08/09/2011, 0400 COT Returned to Service 06/16/2011, 1210 COT 08/10/2011, 1155 COT Reason for Removal from Service Maintenance on ventilation damper in Mode 5 Planned maintenance The guidance in NUREG-1022, Rev. 2, &quot;Event Reporting Guidelines,&quot; indicates an event or condition is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) if either offsite power or onsite emergency power is unavailable to the plant, regardless of whether the other system is available. This condition is, therefore, reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) through (D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, &quot;AC Sources -Operating,&quot; requires two DGs capable of supplying the onsite Class 1 E power distribution subsystem(s) [EllS Codes: E8, ED, and EF] be operable in Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. TS 3.8.2, &quot;AC Sources -Shutdown,&quot; requires one DG to be operable in Modes 5 and 6. With the &quot;A&quot; DG considered inoperable from May 21, 2011 to September 4, 2011 and the &quot;8&quot; DG being inoperable as shown in the table above, multiple TS Conditions 1Required Actions were not completed within the specified Completion Times. Additionally, Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.0.4 was not met when transitioning from Mode 5 to Mode 1. This event is considered a condition prohibited by TS, which is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8). </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><P>-:, F·,~&quot;:~~L;;:.., :.~.:'~;.~ </P><P>.~ ~ ·r ..:., </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) u.s.

Further evaluation of this event is in progress and includes determining whether the &quot;A&quot; DG was capable of performing its specified safety function from May 21, 2011 through September 4, 2011. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The &quot;A&quot; DG Governor was restored to the pre-May 2011 settings. Procedures MPE NE-003, &quot;Governor Adjustments for Emergency Diesel Generator NE01 ,&quot; TMP 11-014, &quot;EDG NE01 Overload Test,&quot; and STS KJ-015A, &quot;Manual/Auto Fast Start Sync and Loading of EDG NE01,&quot; were completed for restoring the &quot;A&quot; DG. The &quot;A&quot; DG was returned to service on September 4, 2011.

SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The &quot;A&quot; DG may have been inoperable from approximately 1300 COT on May 21, 2011 to 1032 COT on September 4, 2011 because the governor was inadequately adjusted. During this time period, the &quot;8&quot; DG was also inoperable as shown previously in the 8asisfor Reportability. When the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;8&quot; DGs are inoperable, there are no remaining stand-by alternating current (AC) sources. Thus, with an assumed loss of otfsite electrical power, sufficient stand-by AC sources are not available to power the minimum required ESF functions. There were six instances in which one out of two offsite circuits was inoperable for a short period of time during scheduled surveillance tests performed from May 21, 2011 through September 4, 2011. However, the required offsite circuits were powering their respective ESF busses during these periods. Procedure STS KJ-001A was successfully completed prior to Wolf Creek Generating Station entering Mode 4 on May 24, 2011. The &quot;A&quot; DG successfully passed the monthly run surveillance four times between the May 2011 adjustment of the DG governor and the oscillation event on September 1, 2011. In each of the four monthly surveillances, the &quot;A&quot; DG was brought to near full load. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML11312A053_img_3.jpg"/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

This event was reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8) as a condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications because Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.3 was not met. The root cause was inadequate procedural guidance concerning test acceptance standards. A contributing cause was a degraded governor which caused difficulty in controlling the DG during testing. LER 2009-005-00: At 1208 CDT on October 22, 2009, the &quot;A&quot; DG was taken out of service for troubleshooting of abnormal alarm indications and the &quot;8&quot; DG was out of service for maintenance during a refueling outage. This event was reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(8) through (D) as a loss of safety function. A Notification of Unusual Event was declared at 1739 CDT on October 22, 2009 and terminated at 0740 CDT on October 23,2009. Power to the safety-related busses was supplied by offsite power and all fuel assemblies were in the Spent Fuel Pool. LER 2011-002-00: On February 22, 2011, the &quot;A&quot; DG was taken out of service when a walk down identified that a control pin on the fuel rack for the &quot;A&quot; DG was not completely inserted and not secured by a washer and cotter pin in accordance with the design. This event was reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) through (D) as a loss of safety function. Power to the safety-related busses was supplied by offsite power and the &quot;8&quot; DG. Corrective actions associated with these previous events addressed different immediate causes and would not have prevented the current reportable event. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
