The IOECCS analysis assumes that initial reactor power is at 102% and initial pressurizer level is at a maximum level of 57%. Given these assumptions, operators must be able to terminate the IOECCS within eight minutes to prevent pressurizer overfill. Operation with pressurizer level above 57% is not bounded by the current analysis. The cause of the event was that the information regarding the assumed pressurizer level for the IOECCS analysis was not identified during the procedure review process. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

The IOECCS analysis applies to Modes 1 through 3 and Mode 1 conditions are used for the worst-case conditions, which bounds the analysis for Mode 2 and 3. The IOECCS analysis assumes that reactor power is at 102% and pressurizer level is at a maximum indicated level of 57%. The upper limit for the pressurizer control band is 57%. Early in 2002, procedure GEN 00-005, &quot;Minimum Load to Hot Standby,&quot; and procedure GEN 00-006, &quot;Hot Standby to Cold Shutdown,&quot; were revised to allow pressurizer level to be controlled between 30% and 65% in Mode 3. Procedure GEN 00-006 allowed pressurizer level to be controlled between 55 to 60% since 1994. One criterion for the IOECCS analysis is that the pressurizer does not become water solid in order to prevent the event from becoming more serious (without other independent failures). The worst-case analysis includes conditions that maximize decay heat, reactor coolant system (RCS) [EllS code: AS] water mass and swell following a reactor trip. The core is assumed to be at 102% power and pressurizer level is assumed to be at the maximum level control program band (57%) plus five percent due to instrument uncertainties. Given these assumptions, operators must be able to terminate the IOECCS within eight minutes to prevent pressurizer overfill. A review of WCGS Mode 3 operation for the last three years was conducted to determine when pressurizer level was above 57%. Four instances were found: 1) January 14, 2008 during a forced outage -pressurizer level reached a maximum of 61% 2) March 20,2008 during refueling outage 16 -pressurizer level reached a maximum of 83%, 3)' October 10, 2009 during refueling outage 17 -pressurizer level reached a maximum of 73% 4) March 3-4, 2010 during a forced outage -pressurizer level reached a maximum of 67% Allowing operation above the pressurizer normal program band level of 57% during Mode 3 changed the starting point of the pressurizer level assumed in the IOECCS analysis. Operation with pressurizer level above 57% is not bounded by the current analysis. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

This condition was determined to constitute an unanalyzed condition and is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73( a)(2)(ii)(B). ROOT CAUSE Procedures GEN 00-005 and GEN 00-006 were revised to allow operation above 57% pressurizer level. The procedure review process only considered the information described in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and did not refer to the actual IOECCS analysis. The USAR description did not discuss the complete IOECCS analysis. As a result, the procedure revision process did not identify the concern. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedures GEN 00-005 and GEN 00-006 were revised to maintain pressurizer level below 57%. WCNOC will review appropriate operating proc~dures to ensure that plant conditions specified in the procedure are enveloped by safety analysis assumptions and evaluations. This action will be completed by May 31,2011. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE Operating above the analyzed pressurizer level band may reduce the time operators have to respond to an IOECCS event. If the response to an IOECCS event is inadequate, the pressurizer will be overfilled, potentially resulting in damage to the pressurizer PORVs or the pressurizer safety valves. If the ECCS system is allowed to continue to inject into the RCS and adequate relief capacity is not available, RCS over pressurization could occur, leading to a breach of the RCS pressure boundary. -Operation outside the analyzed limits for pressurizer level occurred infrequently during plant shutdowns. Although these events placed the power plant in an unanalyzed condition with respect to pressurizer level, other plant parameters such as core average temperature and core power remained within the analysis assumptions. Based on the above, the brief time period the plant operated in such a configuration would not represent a condition that Significantly degraded overall plant safety and thus did not pose a significant safety risk.
