As a result, Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.3 was entered and a plant shutdown was commenced. Mode 3 was entered on September 11, 2013 at 2312 COT. Following the plant shutdown, while in Mode 3, the 'A' steam generator (SG) level approached the Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation Signal setpoint of 23.5 % level. The Control Room operators initiated a manual reactor trip. As a result of the trip, a feedwater isolation signal and a motordriven auxiliary feedwater actuation signal was generated. The cause of the SGK05A failure was an inadequate flush and restoration of the system following actions taken to restore SGK05A in May 2013. The cause of the manual reactor trip and auxiliary feedwater actuation was the lack of crew proficiency to maintain SG levels in Mode 3, immediately following a rapid shutdown. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><P>! </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT During Operator rounds on September 11, 2013, low oil level on the 'A' train Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning (AlC) unit [EllS: VI, ACU] (SGK05A) compressor, elevated vibration and an increase in motor current was observed. The compressor refrigeration parameters (suction pressure, discharge pressure, oil pressure, thermostatic expansion valve [EllS: VI, TCV] (TXV) superheat) were running normal and the room temperatures were being maintained. It was determined that the symptoms were similar to a June 2013 compressor failure reported in LER 2013-007-00. SGK05A was declared nonfunctional per Technical Requirement (TR) 3.7.23, &quot;Class 1 E Electrical Equipment AirConditioning (AlC).&quot; TR 3.7.23 requires two Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC trains be functional in Modes 1 through 4. Because of the essential support function provided by the Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC trains, the correct application of the Technical Specification (TS), upon discovery of a nonfunctional Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC train, is to immediately enter the applicable Conditions and Required Actions under TS 3.8.4, TS 3.8.7, TS 3.8.9, as well as Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.3. On September 11,2013 at 1645 Central Daylight Time (COT), the plant entered LCO 3.0.3. A plant shutdown was commenced on September 11, 2013 at 1645 COT. Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) entered Mode 3 on September 11, 2013 at 2312 COT. Following the plant shutdown, while in Mode 3, the 'A' steam generator (SG) level [EllS: SB, U] was observed approaching the Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation Signal (AFAS) setpoint of 23.5 % level. The Control Room operators initiated a manual reactor trip. As a result of the trip, a feedwater isolation signal (FWIS) and a motor-driven AFAS was generated. After the actuation, SG levels were controlled by manually adjusting the ,auxiliary feedwater pump discharge valves [EllS: BA, V]. Work on 'A' train Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC unit was completed and the unit returned to a functional status on September 26,2013 at 2316 COT. WCGS returned to Mode 1 on September 29, 2013 at 1632 COT. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Additionally, a 4-hour notification was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) when the plant shutdown was initiated. 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) requires reporting &quot;any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).&quot; A manual reactor trip was initiated that actuated the Reactor Protection System and the PWR auxiliary feedwater system actuated. ROOT CAUSE The direct cause of the SGK05A compressor failure occurred from a liquid slug drawn into the compressor resulting in a sudden over pressurization in the cylinder compression volume. One or more thermostatic expansion valves [EllS: VI, TCV] (TXVs) failed open intermittently due to residue on the valve internals. The root cause is that inadequate actions, specifically the chemical flush and evacuation of the system, were taken to restore SGK05A in May 2013. In May 2013, a chemical flush was performed after the failure of a filter-drier [EllS: VI, FL T] in the system allowed filter element material to enter the refrigerant stream resulting in blockage of the TXVs. This was reported in LER 2013-006-01. The apparent cause of the manual reactor trip and auxiliary feedwater actuation was the lack of crew proficiency to maintain SG levels in Mode 3, immediately following a rapid shutdown. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The SGK05A compressor was replaced. The evaporator TXV internals and hot gas bypass valve internals were replaced. Internal inspections were conducted with a boroscope that verified there was no internal contamination. Procedure MPE GK-004, &quot;GK Unit Preparation for Work,&quot; will be revised to include critical steps that are important for ensuring an effective flush and evacuation of the Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC system. The operator training cycle that commenced October 28, 2013, includes a simulator training scenario addressing the control of SG levels following a rapid plant shutdown. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

The safety significance of this event is low since only one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment was potentially affected. The 'B' train Class 1 E electrical equipment NC unit, SGK05B, was not affected and remained functional, and its associated train of Class 1 E electrical equipment was operable. Additionally, the 'A' train Class 1 E electrical equipment room temperatures, cooled by SGK05A, remained below 90 degrees F. OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES LER 2012-005-00 reported a Class 1 E electrical equipment NC train was declared nonfunctional due to a calculation that concluded one train of air conditioning was not capable of supporting both trains of Class 1E equipment. Technical Requirement (TR) 3.7.23 allowed a train to be nonfunctional if compensatory measures were established for the affected unit. During the operability determination and functionality assessment process, it was determined that the operability of the associated train Class 1 E electrical equipment could not be maintained without additional compensatory measures and for a limited period of time. LER 2013-004-00 reported one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning had been nonfunctional and one train of control room air conditioning had been inoperable during the previous cycle. This was discovered during refueling outage 19 when the SGK05A compressor terminal box mounting screws were found over torqued. This resulted in a condition prohibited by Technical Specification and a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function. LER 2013-006-01 reported one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning had been nonfunctional due to a partial blockage of the TXVs feeding the SGK05A evaporator coils. Failure of a filter-drier in the system created the contamination that led to the blockage. This resulted in a plant shutdown required by Technical Specifications. LER 2013-007-00 reported one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning had been nonfunctional due to an analysis of an oil sample that showed elevated levels of aluminum. The NRC granted enforcement discretion that allowed the plant to remain at power while the train was restored to functional status. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
