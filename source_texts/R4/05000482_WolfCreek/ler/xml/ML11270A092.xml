Valve EFHV0060 is required to be closed for post-fire safe shutdown when operating Train &quot;B&quot; essential service water (ESW). The opening of EFHV0060 would cause a flow imbalance in the ESW system and could reduce the ESW flow to other essential components. The direct cause is a latent design deficiency that did not ensure that valve EFHV0060 was isolated/protected from the potential effects of a Control Room fire. An hourly fire watch was in place in the Control Room and will remain in place until this issue is resolved. Procedure OFN RP-017, &quot;Control Room Evacuation,&quot; was revised to include interim compensatory actions to deenergize, and verify closed, valve EFHV0060. A plant modification will be implemented to resolve the PFSSD issue with EFHV0060. </Figure><P>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

Valve EFHV0060 is the Train &quot;B&quot; Essential Service Water (ESW) Return from the Train &quot;B&quot; Component Cooling Water (CCW) Heat Exchanger [EllS Code: CC-HX]. It is a normally closed valve and is required to be closed for post-fire safe shutdown when operating Train &quot;B&quot; ESW. Valve EFV0090 [EllS Code: BI-V], which is installed in parallel with EFHV0060, is throttled to ensure the proper ESW flow balance for normal operation and accident conditions. </P><P>The configuration of EFHV0060 does not meet the requirements of Section III.G.3 of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R because the valve is not isolated from the effects of a Control Room fire. The opening of EFHV0060 would cause a flow imbalance in the ESW system and cooling flow to other essential components could be reduced to below the minimum required flow. Procedure OFN RP-017, &quot;Control Room Evacuation,&quot; had no steps to close this valve or to ensure it is closed. </P><P>BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY </P><P>When a PFSSD issue is identified in which no or insufficient guidance is available to Operations to readily mitigate the postulated fire induced equipment maloperation, the issue is considered reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety. This is based on NUREG-1022, &quot;Event Reporting Guidelines 10 CFR </P><Sect><H5>50.72 and 50.73,&quot; Revision 2, Section 3.2.4. This section provides the following example: </H5><P>.... if fire barriers are found to be missing, such that the required degree of separation for redundant safe shutdown trains is lacking, the event would be reportable as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. </P><P>A 10 CFR 50 Appendix R circuit separation issue, which could result in undesired equipment maloperation with a resulting adverse effect on PFSSD capability, is considered by Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC) to be equivalent to a condition where fire barrier protection is deficient. </P><P>As such, WCNOC is reporting this condition pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) for any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The condition is a design error that has been present since construction. Valve EFHV0060 was not included in the original Control Room evacuation approach documented in letter SLNRC 84-0109. During the post-fire safe shutdown re-analysis project conducted at WCGS, the consequences of the valve failing to open were addressed but not the consequences of the valve spuriously opening. The adverse PFSSD consequences of the valve spuriously opening when operating Train &quot;B&quot; ESW for PFSSD was identified in 2005 and the PFSSD area analyses for areas outside the Control Room were developed to address this concern. However, the impact on the Control Room evacuation procedure was not recognized at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS An hourly fire watch was in place in the Control Room for other issues and will remain in place until this issue is resolved. Procedure OFN RP-017, &quot;Control Room Evacuation,&quot; has been revised to include interim compensatory actions to deenergize, and verify closed, valve EFHV0060_ A plant modification will be implemented to resolve the PFSSD issue with EFHV0060 prior to plant startup following Refuel Outage 19. WCNOC corrective action document PIR 2005-3314 identified an issue where WCNOC did not completely address NRC IN 92-18, &quot;Potential for Loss of Remote Shutdown Capability during a Control Room Fire.&quot; A review of all motor operated valves not previously addressed in PIR 2005-3314 or that are not isolated from the effects of a Control Room fire, will be conducted in an effort to ensure that the scope of NRC IN 92-18 applicable valves is addressed. An independent third party review of the Control Room PFSSD analysis will be performed and will include a review of WCNOC's actions in response to NRC IN 92-18. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE This issue was determined to have low safety significance. A fire in the Control Room of such magnitude and severity as to cause an evacuation and plant shutdown is extremely unlikely. Based on the Fire Hazards Analysis (E-1 F9905), the combustible loading in the Control Room is low and interior finish materials meet or exceed the surface flammability requirements of applicable standards. Cables entering the Control Room are IEEE 383 rated. Large concentrations of cables in the Control Room </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) u.s.

Furthermore, if a fire had occurred in the Control Room that caused the spurious opening of EFHV0060, operators could have throttled valve EFHV0052 [EllS Code: 81-V], &quot;Train &quot;8&quot; ESW inlet to the Train &quot;8&quot; CCW heat exchanger,&quot; to reduce ESW flow through the CCW heat exchanger. OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES LER 2005-007-00 reported a condition where a postulated fire could cause the loss of field flashing for the Train 8 Diesel Generator. This condition was caused by the original Electrical Fire Hazards Analysis completed for WCGS not identifying that field flashing may not be available if a fire occurs in the Control Room. LER 2006-001-00 reported a condition where a re-evaluation of NRC Information Notice 92-18, &quot;Potential For Loss Of Remote Shutdown Capability During A Control Room Fire,&quot; identified that in the event of a fire in the Control Room, 40 motor operated valves credited for post-fire safe shutdown could potentially fail in an unanalyzed condition. LER 2010-003-00 reported a condition where a postulated fire induced hot short could have prevented operation of the Train 8 Diesel Generator if a fire occurred in the Control Room. This condition was due to an inadequate review of Control Room circuitry for impact on PFSSD following a Control Room fire. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
