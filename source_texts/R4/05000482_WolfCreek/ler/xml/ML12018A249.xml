</P><P>DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT 
</P><P>On November 3, 2011, during the 2011 Triennial r-ire Protection Inspection, it was determined 
that procedure OFN RP-017, &quot;Control Room Evacuation,&quot; had two deficiencies. For a postulated 
fire in the control room, the procedure does not adequately protect the steam generators [EllS 
Code: SB] from overfill and does not adequately protect the pressurizer [EllS Code: AB-PZR] 
from filling to above 100% indicated water level. 
</P><P>Procedure OFN RP-017 did not specify the need to isolate normal feedwater [EllS Code: SJ] 
to prevent overfill of the steam generators and provided no guidance to mitigate normal 
feedwater from feeding the steam generators if the main steam isolation valves (MSIV) [EllS 
Code: SB-V) fail to close. This could cause overfill of the steam generators and water 
admission to the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump turbine [EllS Code: BA-TRB]. 
Water admission to the turbine driven AFW pump turbine could cause loss of the pump, a 
component required for achieving safe hot shutdown. It was assumed, that for certain 
scenarios, the MSIVs would close using the &quot;all-close&quot; switches in the control room. The 
MSIVs are verified closed later in the procedure, at approximately 20 minutes. Preliminary 
thermal hydraulic analysis determined that at approximately 3 minutes after the reactor is 
tripped, if the main feed pumps [EllS Code: SJ-P] are not tripped, and flow of feedwater into 
the steam generators is not thereby stopped, the steam generators could overfill, causing 
water to be admitted into the AFW pump turbine steam line resulting in potential damage to 
the pump, 
</P><P>Procedure OFN· RP-O 17 controls water level in the pressurizer by throttling one of the four 
</P><P>boron injection tank (BIT) outlet valves [EllS Code: CB-V) , EM HV8801 B. A Safety Injection 
</P><P>(SI) was not assumed to occur. While reviewing the thermal hydraulic analysis (SA-08-006, 
</P><P>Rev. 2) scenarios supporting OFN RP-017, it was observed that the low pressurizer pressure 
</P><P>SI set point was reached in some of the scenarios. Therefore, an SI signal was possible. If an 
</P><P>SI occurs, all four of the BIT valves may open and throttling only one of the outlet valves may 
</P><P>not prevent overfill of the pressurizer. The procedure does not provide guidance to mitigate 
</P><P>train-A components from injecting water to the primary system due to a spurious or valid SI 
</P><P>until late in the procedure. The train-A components could cause a pressurizer overfill 
</P><P>condition prematurely and challenge the primary system pressure boundary.

LER NUMBER 3. PAGE WOLF CREEK GENERATING STATION 05000 482 YEAR I SEQUENTIAL I REV NUMBER NO. 3 OF 2011 -011 -00 BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY Since a Post Fire Safe Shutdown (PFSSD) issue is identified in which no or insufficient guidance is available to Operations personnel to readily mitigate the postulated fire induced equipment maloperation, the issue is considered reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(8) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety. Since procedure OFN RP-017 would not have provided Operations personnel with the most conservative actions, Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation is reporting this condition pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) for any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. ROOT CAUSE The direct cause of the event is an inadequate analysis assumption translated into procedure OFN RP-017. When the event scenarios were developed in support of procedure OFN RP017, the engineers who worked on the PFSSD analyses did not fully consider the potential adverse effect of automatic functions and improperly credited closure of the main steam isolation valves from the control room. Therefore, the most conservative assumptions were not translated into the procedure. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The apparent cause evaluation (CR 00045442) for this issue has been reviewed with the PFSSD engineers in effort to ensure an understanding of the improper assumptions that were applied in the development of thermal hydraulic analysis SA-OB-006, Rev. 2. Procedure OFN RP-017 was revised to provide compensatory measures that would prevent overfill of either the steam generators or the pressurizer. A complete review of the assumptions that are used in thermal hydraulic analysis SA-OB-006, Rev. 2, will be performed to ensure that the assumptions are complete and accurate. This action will be complete by June 15, 2012. 4 </Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML12018A249_img_2.jpg"/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>· \ .

There were no actual consequences since no fire has occurred in the control room that required evacuation. A fire in the control room of such magnitude and severity as to cause an evacuation and plant shutdown is extremely unlikely. Based on the Fire Hazards Analysis (E-1 F9905), the combustible loading in the control room is low and interior finish materials meet or exceed the surface flammability requirements of applicable standards. Cables entering the control room are IEEE 383 rated. Large concentrations of cables in the control room trenches are protected with an automatic Halon extinguishing system, and automatic smoke detectors are located in the control cabinets and trenches. OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES LER 2010-003-00 reported a condition where a postulated fire induced hot short could have prevented operation of the train 'B' diesel generator if a fire occurred in the control room. This condition was due to an inadequate review of control room Circuitry for impact on the PFSSD analyses following a control room fire. LER 2010-008-00 reported a condition where a postulated fire in the control room could cause a flow imbalance in the Essential Service Water system and cooling flow to other essential components could be reduced to below the minimum required flow. This was caused by a latent design deficiency. </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
