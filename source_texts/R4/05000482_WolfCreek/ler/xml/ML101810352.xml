The &quot;8&quot; ESW train was declared inoperable per Technical Requirement (TR) 3.4.17, &quot;Structural Integrity,&quot; and Condition A of LCO 3.7.8, &quot;Essential Service Water (ESW) System,&quot; was entered. This resulted in the &quot;8&quot; diesel generator (DG) being declared inoperable and entering Condition 8 of LCO 3.8.1. Required Action 8.3.1 for TS 3.8.1 is to determine if the operable DG is inoperable due to a common cause failure. Control room personnel utilized procedure SYS KJ-200, &quot;Inoperable Emergency Diesel,&quot; when the DG was declared inoperable and determined that a common cause failure did not exist. At 1202 CDT Required Action 8.3.1 was exited. At 2140 CDT, a structural integrity evaluation utilizing Code Case N~513-2 demonstrated that adequate structural integrity of the &quot;8&quot; ESW train existed. The &quot;8&quot; ESW train and &quot;8&quot; DG were declared operable. Subsequent to the restoration of the &quot;8&quot; ESW train and &quot;8&quot; DG on June 30, 2009, the NRC Resident Inspector challenged the adequacy of the common cause failure determination. On November 10, 2009, NRC Inspection Report 2009004 identified a Green noncited violation of Technical Specification 3.8.1 for failure to perform an adequate common cause evaluation within 24 hours to demonstrate no common cause failure mechanism existed between the operable and inoperable emergency diesel generators.

Required Action A.1 of LCO 3.7.8 has a Note to enter the applicable Conditions and Required Actions of LCO 3.8.1, uAC Sources -Operating,&quot; for a diesel generator (DG) made inoperable by the ESW System. This resulted in the u8&quot; DG [EllS Code: EK] being declared inoperable and entering Condition 8 of LCO 3.8.1. Required Action 8.3.1 for TS 3.8.1 is to determine if the operable DG is inoperable due to a common cause failure. Control room personnel utilized procedure SYS KJ-200, ulnoperable Emergency Diesel,&quot; when the DG was declared inoperable and determined that a common cause failure did not exist. Step 6.1.5 of SYS KJ-200 specifies to document the evaluation of common cause on the procedure cover sheet. The documented evaluation indicated that u8&quot; DG inoperability was not common cause due to the u8&quot; train ESW being inoperable. At 1202 CDT Required Action 8.3.1 was exited. Subsequent discussions with control room staff indicated that a dedicated walkdown after identification of the leak on the u8&quot; train was not performed. This decision was due to the affected location on the &quot;A&quot; train being in the same room and a leak on the uA&quot; train would have been easily observed by the building watch as part of building watch rounds (the leak on U8&quot; ESW train was discovered during building watch rounds). At 2140 CDT, a structural integrity evaluation utilizing Code Case N-513-2 demonstrated that adequate structural integrity of the u8&quot; ESW train existed. The u8&quot; ESW train and u8&quot; DG were declared operable. Condition Report (CR) 00018217 was initiated on June 30, 2009 for the identified leak on EF138H8C-30. The structural integrity evaluation was documented in Work Order (WO) 09-318203-002. Five augmented examinations at locations similar in configuration to the identified leak were required based on Code Case N-5132. The code case requires the augmented examinations to be performed within 30 days. The below table provides information on the five augmented examinations.

On November 10, 2009, NRC Inspection Report 2009004 identified a Green noncited violation of Technical Specification 3.8.1 for failure to perform an adequate common cause evaluation within 24 hours to demonstrate no common cause failure mechanism existed between the operable and inoperable emergency diesel generators. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by the plant's TSs. WCNOC's review of this event determined that the event did not meet the criteria for reporting under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function. The &quot;A&quot; DG was operable during the time frame that the &quot;B&quot; DG was inoperable and the &quot;B&quot; DG was restored to operable status prior to the expiration of the Required Action B.3.1 Completion Time. There were no indications that the &quot;A&quot; DG was inoperable and a common cause determination would not have been required by TSs. Therefore, onsite emergency power was available to the plant and would not be reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). CAUSE: Specific information that was incorporated into the current technical specifications (CTS) (pre-improved TSs (ITS) via Amendment No. 123) and CTS Bases as a result of Amendment No. 101 was not incorporated into the expanded ITS and ITS Bases developed during the conversion to the ITS so as to more closely adhere to standardization. As a result, no changes were made to procedure SYS KJ-200, &quot;Inoperable Emergency Diesel,&quot; as the basis for considering there is no common cause failure due to an inoperable support system was maintained. The bases for this cause is discussed below. On September 15, 1995, WCNOC submitted a license amendment request proposing to revise TS 3/4.8.1, &quot;Electrical Power Systems -AC.

With one diesel generator of the above required AC. electrical power sources inoperable, demonstrate the OPERABILITY of the offsite AC. sources by performing Specification 4.8.1.1.1 within 1 hour and at least once per 8 hours thereafter. Demonstrate the OPERABILITY of the remaining OPERABLE diesel generator by performing Specification 4.8.1.1.2a.4 within 24 hours**, unless the absence of any potential common mode failure for the remaining diesel generator is demonstrated, or if the diesel generator· became inoperable due to any cause other than an inoperable support system, an independently testable component, preplan ned preventative maintenance or testing, or maintenance to correct a condition which, if left uncorrected, would not affect the OPERABILITY of the diesel generator; restore the inoperable diesel generator to OPERABLE status within 72 hours or be in at least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. **This test is required to be completed regardless of when the inoperable diesel generator is restored to OPERABLE status unless the diesel 'Nas declared inoperable to do preplanned preventative maintenance, testing, or maintenance to correct a condition 'Nhich, if left uncorrected, 'Nould not affect the operability of the diesel generator. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

The changes were proposed based on the guidance in Generic Letter 93-05. Generic Letter 93-05 provided guidance for TS improvements to reduce surveillance requirements for testing based on the results reported in NUREG-1366, &quot;Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.&quot; Specifically item 10.1 in Enclosure 1 of the generic letter recommended changes to the emergency diesel generator surveillance requirements. Recommendation (1) stated: &quot;When a EDG itself is inoperable (not including a support system or independently testable component), the other EDG(s) should be tested .only once (not every 8 hours) and within 8 hours unless the absence of any potential common mode failure can be demonstrated.&quot; This specific change was approved in Amendment No.1 01 on August 9, 1996. The Safety Evaluation associated with Amendment No.1 01, stated, in part: The proposed changes are consistent with the recommendations contained in GL 93-05. Also, these changes are in conformance with Action B of TS 3.8.1 of the STS. The GL suggests that when an EDG is inoperable (not including a support system or independently testable component), the other EDG should be tested only once, unless the absence of any potential common mode failure can be demonstrated. Information provided in the STS indicates that 24 hours is a reasonable time frame to confirm that the operable EDG is not affected by the same problem as the inoperable EDG. The licensee reports that 24 hours is compatible with plant operating experience. Thus, the proposed changes are acceptable. Note that Section 1.0 of the Safety Evaluation for Amendment No.1 01 indicates that the proposed changes would incorporate recommendations and suggestions from GL 93-05; the improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1431, &quot;Standard Technical Specification -Westinghouse Plants&quot; (STS); and other NRC guidance documents. The wording in the Safety Evaluation indicates that the wording of the STS (NUREG-1431) are such that the common cause failure determination or performing SR 3.8.1.2 for the operable DG are not necessary if the inoperable DG were inoperable due to an inoperable support system, an independently testable component, preplanned preventative maintenance or testing, or maintenance to correct a condition which, if left uncorrected, would not affect the operability of the DG. WCNOC letter ET 97-0050, dated May 15, 1997, provided the WCGS Technical Specification Conversion Application. The conversion application included a markup of current TS 3.8.1.1 Action b. and removed the associated wording associated with the DG being inoperable due to any cause other than an inoperable support system. The associated discussion of change (DOC 1-05-LS-6) indicates that the change was considered a less restrictive change and the DOC further indicates that the change was based on the guidance in Generic Letter 84-15 and Generic Letter 93-05. While the expanded wording that was in the CTSs was not incorporated into the ITS or ITS Bases, the justification indicates that the intent of the ITS wording is based on the guidance in Generic Letter 8415 and Gen~ric Letter 93-05 (an inoperable support system that results in the inoperability of the DG is not considered a common cause failure or would not require the performance of SR 3.8.1.2). ACTIONS TAKEN: As a result of an additional leak on &quot;B&quot; ESW train on July 27,2009 and additional discussions with NRC staff on July 28, 2009, direction was provided to control room personnel that when a DG is declared inoperable, for the purposes of meeting LCO 3.8.1, Required Actions B.3.1 or B.3.2, perform SR 3.8.1.2 for the operable DG unless the DG were declared inoperable for preplanned maintenance or testing. Procedure SYS KJ-200 was revised to reflect the guidance provided to control room personnel. WCNOC submitted a license amendment request (letter WO 09-0039, dated November 20, 2009) that proposed to revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, &quot;AC Sources -Operating,&quot; consistent with the changes previously approved in Amendment No. 101 and with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05, &quot;Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation (Generic Letter 93-05).&quot; </TH></TR></Table><P>t </P><P>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

The 72 hour Completion Time takes into account the capacity and capability of the remaining ac sources, a reasonable time for repairs, and the low probability of a Design BasisAccident (DBA) occurring during this period. A structural integrity evaluation utilizing Code Case N-513-2 demonstrated that adequate structural integrity of the &quot;B&quot; ESW train existed. </P><P>The event did not result in any challenges to the fission product barriers or result in the release of radioactive materials. Therefore, there were no adverse safety consequences or implications as a result of this event and the event did not adversely affect the safe operation of the plant or health and safety of the public. </P><P>OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS EVENTS: </P><P>NRC Inspection Report 2007005 identified a green noncited violation of TS 3.8.1·for failure to perform an adequate common cause failure evaluation within 24 hours when the &quot;A&quot; DG tripped on reverse power on November 1, 2007, and resulted in replacement of the digital reference unit. This noncited violation identified that an evaluation of the &quot;A&quot; DG did not use correct information to explain the observed failure mechanism, and both DGs were susceptible to a 10 CFR Part 21 notification that WCNOC did not evaluate until November 6,2007. This event was not the result of an inoperable support system. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
