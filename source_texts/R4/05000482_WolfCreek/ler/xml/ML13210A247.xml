As a result, Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation 3.0.3 was entered and a plant shutdown was commenced. Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) entered Mode 3 on May 7,2013 at 0009 COT. The immediate cause of the temperature increase was damage to the liquid line filter-dryer assembly. This resulted in the partial blockage of the thermostatic expansion valves feeding the SGK05A evaporator coils. The thermostatic expansion valves and filter-dryer assembly were replaced and WCGS returned to Mode 1 on 5/13/2013 at 0832 COT. The root cause of this event is being evaluated and will be provided in the supplement to this Licensee Event Report (LER). </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10·2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) U_S_ NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1_ FACILITY NAME </TH><TD>2_ DOCKET </TD><TD>6_ LER NUMBER </TD><TD>3_ PAGE </TD></TR><TR><TH>WOLF CREEK GENERATING STATION </TH><TD>05000 482 </TD><TD>YEAR ISEQUENTIAL I REV NUMBER NO. </TD><TD>2 OF 3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2013 -006 -00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>PLANT CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT Mode -1 100 percent power There were no structures, components or systems (SSC) that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event. DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On May 5, 2013, Operators identified an increasing temperature trend for the 'A' train safety related electrical equipment room. The trend began one month earlier with a gradual increase of approximately 11 degrees Fahrenheit (F). On May 6, 2013 at 1733 Central Daylight Time (COT), the Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning (AlC) unit [EllS: VI, ACU], SGK05A, which cools the 'A' train safety related electrical equipment rooms was declared nonfunctional per Technical Requirement (TR) 3.7.23, &quot;Class 1 E Electrical Equipment Air-Conditioning (AlC).&quot; TR 3.7_23 requires two Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC trains be functional in Modes 1 through 4. Because of the essential support function provided by the Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC trains, the correct application of the Technical Specification (TS), upon discovery of a nonfunctional Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC train, is to immediately enter the applicable Conditions and Required Actions under TS 3.8.4, TS 3.8.7, TS 3.8.9, as well as Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0_3. A plant shutdown was commenced on 5/6/2013 at 1801 COT Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) entered Mode 3 on 5/7/2013 at 0009 COT Troubleshooting determined that the SGK05A evaporator coils [EllS: VI, EVP, CL] were being starved of refrigerant, which was consistent with blockage of the thermostatic expansion valves [EllS: VI, TCV]. Further examination identified a foreign material on the inlet thermostatic expansion valve screens. The foreign material was determined to be filter-dryer assembly [EllS: VI, FL T] core material that had broken down and entered the system. The thermostatic expansion valves are Sporlan Model Number SVE-8-CP100. The filter-dryer assembly is a Sporlan Model C-1449. Examination of the liquid line filter-dryer assembly internals identified damage to one of the three filter cores and the outlet plate and filter tube assembly. The filter tube and outlet plate are designed to prevent any carryover of the filter-dryer core material into the refrigerant stream. The damage to the core material appears consistent with erosion caused by liquid refrigerant flowing across the edge of the core element created by the failure of the connection between the filter tube and the outlet plate. The system was flushed and the thermostatic expansion valves and filter-dryer assembly were replaced. It was confirmed that this issue did not exist with the 'B' train Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC unit, SGK05R The operating history of similar AlC units was reviewed and no similar problems were found at WCGS. Work on 'A' train Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC unit was completed and the unit returned to a functional status on May 11, 2013 at 0451 COT WCGS returned to Mode 1 on May 13, 2013 at 0832 COT </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>(10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Additionally, a 4-hour notification was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) when the plant shutdown was initiated. ROOT CAUSE The root cause of this event is being evaluated and will be provided in the supplement to this Licensee Event Report (LER). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The system was flushed and the thermostatic expansion valves and filter-dryer assembly were replaced. It was confirmed that this issue did not exist with the 'B' train Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC unit, SGK05B. The operating history of similar AlC units was reviewed and no similar problems were found at WCGS. Corrective actions to prevent recurrence are being developed to address the root cause and will be provided in the supplement to this LER. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The Class 1 E electrical equipment AlCsystem operates in a continuous recirculation mode to maintain the engineered safety features (ESF) switchgear rooms [EllS: EB, SWGR], battery rooms [EllS: EJ, BTRY] and the DC switchgear rooms [EllS: EJ, SWGR] at or below the design temperature of 90 degrees F during all modes of plant operation, including loss of preferred offsite power and post-accident operation. The safety significance of this event is low since only one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment was potentially affected. The 'B' train Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC unit, SGK05B, was not affected and remained functional, and its associated train of Class 1 E electrical equipment was operable. Additionally, room temperatures remained below 90 degrees F. OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES LER 2012-005-00 reported a Class 1 E electrical equipment AlC train was declared nonfunctional due to a calculation that concluded one train of air conditioning was not capable of supporting both trains of Class 1 E equipment. Technical Requirement (TR) 3.7.23 allowed a train to be nonfunctional if compensatory measures were established for the affected unit. During the operability determination and functionality assessment process, it was determined that the operability of the associated train Class 1 E electrical equipment could not be maintained without additional compensatory measures and for a limited period of time. LER 2013-004-00 reported one train of Class 1 E electrical equipment air conditioning had been nonfunctional and one train of control room air conditioning had been inoperable during the previous cycle. This was discovered during refueling outage 19 when the SGK05A compressor terminal box mounting screws were found over torqued. This resulted in a condition prohibited by Technical Specification and a condition that could havepJevented the fulfillment of a safety function. </TH></TR></Table><P>&quot; NRC FORM 366A NRC FORM 366A (10·2010 </P></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
