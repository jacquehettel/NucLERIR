The cause of the TS required shutdown of WCGS was the inability to return the EDG to operable status within the seven-day completion time of Required Action 8.4.2.2 of TS 3.8.1. The extended out-of-service time was due to excessive emergent work activities, including a drop in peak firing pressure in one cylinder during the surveillance run of the EDG.

The Wolf Creek Generating Station EDGs are Fairbanks Morse Pielstick Model 2.5 Diesel Generators. The scope of the TSEO included removal and replacement of the Jacket Water heat exchanger [EllS Code: LB-HX] and preventative maintenance activities. During the TSEO, a number of delays occurred and a high number of emergent work activities impacted the schedule. On December 6, 2010, the final surveillance run for declaring the Train 'A' EDG operable was being conducted per procedure STS KJ-015A, &quot;Manual/Auto Fast Start, Sync &amp; Loading Of EDG NE01.&quot; During the surveillance run, engine analysis identified that the peak firing pressure for cylinder No. 12 was almost 500 psig less than the data collected during the maintenance run performed on December 5, 2010. This condition occurred with approximately three hours left until the Allowed Outage Time for the TSEO was exceeded. It was determined that the condition could not be fixed within the remaining time in the TSEO. On December 6, 2010, at 0418 CST, a shutdown of the reactor was commenced. Required Action H.1 of TS 3.8.1 was entered on December 6, 2010, at 0500 CST. As a result, Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) entered Mode 3 on December 6, 2010, at 0948 CST. The retaining bolt for the fuel injector pump timing adjustment lock plate on the No. 12 cylinder had backed out due to a loose/deformed keeper plate. This affected the timing of the injector pump and caused the reduction in the cylinder pressure. The remaining cylinders were inspected and no other problems were found. Work on the Train 'A' EDG was completed and the EDG was returned to operable status on December 7,2010 at 0100 CST. WCGS returned to Mode 1 on December 8,2010 at 1848 CST. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1()'2010) u.s.

Additionally, a 4-hour notification was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) when the plant shutdown was initiated on December 6, 2010. ROOT CAUSE The cause of the plant shutdown was an excessive number of emergent work items occurred during the Train 'A' EDG TSEO. Each individual emergent work activity could have been managed within the allowed outage time, but the number and sequence of discovery was such that the cumulative effect of these activities precluded EDG recovery within the allowed out-of-service time. As a result, Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation was unable to restore the Train 'A' EDG within the allowed seven-day completion time of Required Action B.4.2.2 of TS 3.8.1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Prior to commencing the 'B' EDG TSEO, corrective actions included a re-evaluation of work package content, engineering dispositions, contingencies and workgroup preparations. Additionally, the Command and Control structure used for seven-day TSEOs was changed to improve management of work delays and effectively control emergent work. These actions ensured that a similar TSEO for the Train '8' EDG in January 2011 was successfully completed. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE This event is of low safety significance. The Train '8' EDG, the off-site diesel gensets used for peak loading located at the Sharpe Station, and offsite power were available during the inoperability of the Train 'A' EDG. </TH></TR><Caption><P>LER 2010-011-00 details the completion of a required Technical Specification shutdown due to water leakage from a buried portion of the Train 'A' Essential Service Water (ESW) system [EllS Code: 81]. Subsequent Engineering evaluation of the through-wall leak concluded that the ESW system was capable of performing its design safety function. </P></Caption></Table><P>OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS EVENTS </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
