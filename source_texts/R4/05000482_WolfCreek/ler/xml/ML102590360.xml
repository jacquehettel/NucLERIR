The last time they could account for the key was approximately 1200 CST. An extensive search was conducted of all the areas that the operator had been. In accordance with Regulatory Guide 5.62, Section C.2.2.16, and 10 CFR 73.71 (b), a one-hour notification was made to the NRC.

The last time they could account for the key was approximately 1200 CST when they went to lunch. An extensive search was conducted by Operations and Security personnel of all the areas that the operator had been. An alarm report was run to account for all unknown alarms, which showed that alLintrusion alarms were known or had been responded to. Security implemented a High Security corelock rotation of all areas compromised by the lost key as required by 10 CFR 73.55(g)6.D. On 7/13/2010 at 0510 CST, the high security key was found in the Control Room on top of a cabinet. BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY A one-hour notification to the NRC was made per Regulatory Guide 5.62, Section C.2.2.16, for a lost key and per 10 CFR 73.71 (b). A written report is required in 60 days per 10 CFR 73.71 (a)4. ROOT CAUSE The cause of the missing key was personnel error, inattention to detail. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A robust device/method will be used to attach the high security key to the lanyard of the operations personnel. This action will be completed by December 23, 2010. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The event was determined not to be risk significant because the key was always in the Control Room. There were no systems affected or threatened, directly or indirectly during this event. . OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS EVENTS A review of the past three years found seven incidents were high security keys were misplaced. None of these events were reportable because the keys were found within one hour of being mispla~ed. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007 </P></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
