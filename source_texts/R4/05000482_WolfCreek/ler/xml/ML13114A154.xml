DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On February 10, 2013 at 0900 hours Central Standard Time (CST), fuel offload was started as part of Refueling Outage 19. The approved fuel offload pattern assumed source range monitors SENI0031 [EIIS:IG-DET] and SENI0032 [EIIS:IG-DET] would remain operable during fuel movement. Source range monitors SENI0060A [EIIS:IG-DET] and SENI0061A [EIIS:IG-DET] were not credited for meeting Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.3, &quot;Nuclear Instrumentation,&quot; as the fuel offload pattern would eventually uncouple these detectors from the core. The fuel offload activity was delayed at various times due to problems with the transfer cart and the refueling machine. These delays resulted in the fuel offload extending past the scheduled February 15, 2013, start time for maintenance on nuclear instrumentation cabinet SE054A [EIIS:IG-CAB] under Work Order (WO) 11347036-000. WO 11-347036-000 was previously initiated to replace the resistor-capacitor suppressors in the nuclear instrumentation cabinet SE054A. There were six sub-work orders associated with this maintenance activity. Scheduling of five of the six sub-work orders had been moved due to the delays with fuel offload. One of the sub-work orders was still on the outage schedule to be worked on February 15, 2013. The performance of this work would require taking source range monitor SENI0031 out of service making the monitor inoperable. On February 15, 2013, fuel offload had been delayed for approximately the previous 48 hours with 85 of 193 fuel assemblies offloaded. On February 15, 2013, Instrumentation and Control personnel requested permission from the Operations Work Controls Senior Reactor Operator to perform WO 11347036-000. At 2134 hours, SEN 10031 was declared inoperable for performance of WO 11-347036000. On February 16, 2013, at 0426 hours, fuel offload was recommenced. At 0933 hours, fuel movement was suspended due to the refueling machine hoist joystick sticking. At 1137 hours, fuel offload was recommenced. At 1500 hours on February 16, 2013, LCO 3.9.3 was declared not met when it was determined that the source range monitors SENI0060A and SENI0061A were not both coupled to the core and source range neutron flux monitor SENI0031 was inoperable. Condition A of TS 3.9.3 was entered and core alterations were suspended and operations that would cause positive reactivity additions were suspended per Required Action A.1 and Required Action A.2. On February 16, 2013, at 1620 hours, cabinet SE054A and monitor SENI0031 were returned to service. At 1633 hours, fuel offload was recommenced. </TH></TR></Table><P>' .. </P><P>• .6-.-</P><P>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) NRC FORM 366A (10 2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

The TS 3.9.3 Bases indicates that the source range neutron flux monitors SENI0031 and SENI0032 (Westinghouse Boron trifluoride detectors) are the normal source range monitors used during refueling outages. The source range monitors SENI0060A or SENI0061A (Gamma-Metrics fission chambers) provide an acceptable equivalent control room visual indication with the complete fuel inventory set within the reactor vessel or with the monitors coupled to the core. Either the set of two Westinghouse source range neutron flux monitors or the set of two Gamma-Metrics source range monitors may be used to perform the reactivity monitoring function. A fuel assembly is &quot;coupled&quot; to another fuel assembly if the two fuel assemblies are face adjacent. If a path of face adjacent fuel assemblies can be drawn to a baffle location nearest to a source range detector, the fuel assembly is &quot;coupled&quot; to the source range detector. With the core partially offloaded when SENI0031 was removed from service at 2134 hours CST on February 15, 2013, the core was not coupled with the Gamma-Metrics source range monitors. As such, LCO 3.9.3 was not met. Core offload activities were recommenced at 0426 hours on February 16, 2013 and suspended at 0933 due to problems with the refueling machine. Core offload activities were recommenced at 1137 hours. At 1500 hours, core offload activities were suspended when it was recognized that requirements of LCO 3.9.3 were not met. Condition A of TS 3.9.3 requires the immediate suspension of core alterations with one required source range neutron flux monitor inoperable. Therefore, this event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TSs. ROOT CAUSE The night shift Instrumentation and Control Supervisor made a non-conservative decision to perform work on nuclear instrumentation cabinet SE054A and source range monitor SENI0031 when fuel offload had not been completed. The night shift Instrumentation and Control Supervisor misunderstood the schedule logic ties in WO 11-347036-000 and did not verify that the WO predecessors were complete. The Work Controls Senior Reactor Operator made a non-conservative decision to remove a source range monitor SENI0031 from service when fuel offload had not been completed. The Work Controls Senior Reactor Operator, with peer check from the Control Room Supervisor and the Shift Manager, reviewed the TSs and determined that source range monitors SENI0060A or SENI0061A would be operable, but failed to identify the requirement for these monitors to be coupled to the core. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Condition A of TS 3.9.3 was entered and core alterations were suspended and operations that would cause positive reactivity additions were suspended per Required Action A.1 and Required Action A.2. The involved Instrumentation and Controls Supervisor was coached by the Instrumentation and Controls Superintendent on the importance of checking schedule predecessors prior to assigning work to be performed. The involved Work Controls Senior Reactor Operator, Control Room Supervisor, and Shift Manager were coached by the Operations Management on the importance of checking schedule predecessors prior to approving work and the importance of understanding TS applicability for the given plant conditions and planned activities. Senior Reactor Operator stand-downs were performed to emphasize the failures in operator fundamentals that occurred in this event. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE The source range neutron flux monitors provide a signal to alert the operators to unexpected changes --in core reactivity, such as a boron dilution accident or an improperly loaded fuel assembly. The safety significance is low for this event. At the time of this event, one source range neutron flux monitor (SEN10032) was operable with visible count rate indication, an audible high flux at shutdown alarm in the control room, and audible indication of count rate in the control room and containment. Both source range neutron flux monitor SENI0060A and SENI0061A were functioning with visible count rate indication, but these monitors could not be used to satisfy LCO 3.9.3 as only one monitor was coupled to the core.
