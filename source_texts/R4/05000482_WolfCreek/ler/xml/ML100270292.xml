Procedure AP 22C-003, &quot;Operational Risk Assessment Program,&quot; specifies that this procedure is applicable in Modes 1, 2, or 3. An Operational Risk Assessment was prepared for the period November 17, 2009 through November 22, 2009, in preparation for transifioning from Mode 4 to Mode 3 and plant startup on November 17. The day-shift Shift Manager had annotated Section 5.3, &quot;Compensatory measures added because of unscheduled activities&quot; of the Operational Risk Assessment at 1705 hours Central Standard Time (CST). The annotation specified that when entering Mode 3 with the turbine driven AFW pump inoperable, protected equipment signs should be placed on the motor driven AFW pump room doors. However, this Operational Risk Assessment was not in effect since the plant had not transitioned to Mode 3. A separate risk assessment for entering Mode 3 from Mode 4 with the turbine driven AFW pump inoperable was completed as required by Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.4b. and provided the following in Block 5, &quot;Comments/Risk Management Actions/Compensatory Measures&quot;: It is expected that the PAL02 activity will work around the clock to minimize the unavailability time of the pump. Protected train signs may be posted as deemed necessary. Without PAL02, it will be a good practice (prior to the mode change) to verify with the Transmission Operator that there are no known grid stability issues. This would be in addition to the hourly predictive grid assessment by the Transmission Operator. No additional precautions or compensatory measures beyond those discussed in AP 22C-003 Attachment B are deemed necessary. The transition from Mode 4 to Mode 3 did not occur during the day-shift on November 17, 2009. The night-shift Shift Manager in preparation for transitioning from Mode 4 to Mode 3 determined that plant conditions did not warrant the placement of the protected equipment signs on the motor driven pump rooms. However, the Operational Risk Assessment was not updated to reflect this petermination. On November 17; 2009, at 2353 hours, Control Room personnel authorized the transition from Mode 4, Hot Shutdown, to Mode 3, Hot Standby, in accordance with LCO 3.0.4b. with the turbine driven AFW pump inoperable and no specific risk management actions required. On November 18, 2009, at 0024 hours, the plant transitioned from Mode 4 to Mode 3 under the provisions of LCO 3.0.4b. for the turbine driven AFW pump being inoperable with no protected equipment signs for the motor driven AFW pump rooms. The turbine driven AFW pump was declared operable on November 19, 2009 at 0433 hours. </TH></TR></Table><P>) </P><P>/ </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

TS LCO 3.0.4 states, in part &quot;When an LCO is not met, entry into a MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability shall only be made: b. After performance of a risk assessment addressing inoperable systems and components, consideration of the results, determination of the acceptability of entering the MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability, and establishment of risk management actions, if appropriate; exceptions to this Specification are stated in the individual Specifications; or&quot; ..... On December 17, 2009, at a weekly meeting with the NRC Resident Inspector, the inspector identified a potential violation of LCO 3.0.4b. for not establishing risk management actions prior to transitioning from Mode 4 to Mode 3 as required by the technical specification. The risk management action not established was protected equipment signage for the motor driven AFW pump rooms. During the period of time when the turbine driven AFW pump was inoperable, at least one motor driven AFW pump was operable and capable of providing the feedwater flow required for removal of decay heat. As such, review of this event determined that it did not meet the criteria for reporting under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fullfillment of a safety function. CAUSE: The cause of this event and additional actions being taken are still being evaluated and will be reported in a supplement to this LER. ACTIONS TAKEN: On November 18, 2009, the day-shift Shift Manager reviewed current plant conditions and after consultation with the Outage Control Center Operations Manager posted protected equipment signs on the motor driven AFW pump room doors based on procedure AI 22C-10, &quot;Operations Work Controls.&quot; SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE: The AFW System mitigates the consequences of any event with loss of normal feedwater. The design basis of the AFW System is to supply water to the steam generator to remove decay heat and other residual heat by delivering at least the minimum required flow rate to the steam generators at pressures corresponding to the lowest steam generator safety valve set pressure plus 3% accumulation. In addition, the AFW System must supply enough makeup water to replace steam generator secondary inventory lost as the unit cools to MODE 4 conditions. Sufficient AFW flow must also be available to account for flow losses such as pump recirculation and line breaks. The AFW System consists of two motor driven AFW pumps and one steam turbine driven pump configured into three, trains. Each motor driven pump provides 100% of the feedwater flow required for removal of decay heat from the reactor. During the period of time when the turbine driven AFW pump was inoperable, at least one motor driven AFW pump was operable and capable of providing the feedwater flow required for removal of decay heat. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A ,.' .. ifj' :&quot; ';';.+: u.s.
