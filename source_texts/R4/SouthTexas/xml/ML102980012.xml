The reactor trip was caused by a human performance error that occurred when the procedure performer and verifier missed a procedure step. The Root Cause for the reactor trip was determined to be: 1. Procedure place keepin'g standards for the site were less than adequate and 2. Supervisory Oversight of surveillance test procedure OPSP03-SP-0006R became ineffective when the Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) stepped outside of his oversight role and became involved in the process. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>N~C FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1·2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT STP Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event. . D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT August 20, 2010 at approximately 1500 hours, a Unit 1 Reactor Operator (RO) functioning as a Test Coordinator (TC) commenced performing Surveillance Test OPSP03-SP-0006R, Train R Reactor Trip Breaker Trip Actuating Device Operability Test (TADOT), in the Unit 1 Solid State Protection System (SSPS) Train R cabinet. The Unit 2 Field Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) performed the supervisor oversight and dual verification in support of the test activities. During the performance of procedure OPSP03-'SP-0006R section 5.3, the TC and SRO completed steps 5.3.1 through 5.3.3 in the SSPS Train R cabinet. The TC then directed the Plant Operators (POs) to perform step 5.3.4 to ensure the Reactor Trip Bypass Breaker R closed. Once the POs reported that step 5.3.4 was completed, the TC then proceeded with steps 5.3.5, then appropriately marked steps 5.3.6 through 5.3.8 as Not Applicable (N/A); and then performed step 5.3.9. The TC then paged forward in the procedure and inadvertently turned two pages instead of one page. This resulted in the TC missing procedure step 5.3.10 that would have blocked the Turbine Trip actuation signal. The SRO did not notice the TC had missed a procedure page. The TC completed step 5.3.12 and the SRO performed the Dual Verification (DV) for the step. The , SRO then took the test procedure book to the 10 foot elevation of the Electrical Auxiliary Building qnd observed Electricians take the continuity reading for the test. After the Electricians performed their step in the procedure, the SRO returned to the SSPS Train R cabinet and gave the TC the procedure book. The TC then directed the POs to perform steps 5.3.14, 5.3.15, and 5.3.16 at the Reactor Trip Switchgear. While the POs were performing their steps, the TC and SRO discussed how they would perform step 5.3.17. With that discussion the TC and SRO agreed the prudent method to perform step 5.3.17 would be for the TC to manage the procedure book and the headset and the SRO would depress the test pushbuttons. Both the TC and SRO read the procedure step 5.3.17, after which the SRO depressed the test pushbuttons </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY Upon hearing the Unit 1. Reactor trip announcement; the SRO returned to the Unit 1 Control Room to perform the Shift Technical Advisor (STA) duties for a Reactor trip. 'After Unit 1 was stable, the SRO reviewed the paperwork for OPSP03-SP-0006R and noted the missed procedure step. The SROnotified the Unit 1 Shift Manager (SM) regarding the missed procedure step in OPSPO~-SP-0006R that caused the Unit 1 Reactor trip. II. EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED All required safety. systems responded as expected including the following actuations: 1. Reactor Protection System P-16, Train R Initiated Turbine Trip . 2. Reactor Protection System P-9, with Reactor Power&gt; 50% Initiated a Reactor Trip 3. Feedwater Isolation Actuation 4. Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation (All AFW pumps actuated) 5. Primary Pressure Cont'rol (Pressurizer Spray arid Heaters actuated as required) 6. Secondary Pre?sure Control Actuation (Steam Dumps Actuated) B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY N/A C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT Extent of Condition: The extent of condition for this event exists in the SSPS surveillance tests for system/component actuation circuitry that verifies the circyit with the output blocked. The extent of condition also can affect tests and/or procedures that are conducted from a controlling station with multiple locations performing procedure steps and/or sections. The investigation identified two root causes associated with the event and four (4) deficiencies. From a broader perspective, the corrective actions addressing the root causes are adequate to address this extent of condition across the site. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1·2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The conditional probability of a large early release given a turbine trip is 6E-09 .. This event did not impact or jeopardize nuclear safety; plant mitigating system and personnel responded as expected when the plant tripped. The event did not challenge or impact the plant's emergency preparedness or plant security abilities to perform their functions. The event did not impact or jeopardize radiological safety, the public safety, or the safety of station personnel. Operability and functionality of risk-significant equipment was not affected by this event. Plant reliability was not affected. The plant experienced an unplanned and uncomplicated automatic reactor trip. ) III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT Root Cause No.1 (Organizational) Procedure place keeping standards for the site were less than adequate. Personnel performing surveillance test procedure OPSP03-SP-0006R inadvertently turned forward in the procedure two pages instead of one page as they had intended. In doing so, a critical test step that would have blocked a Turbine Trip signal was missed. The missed page went undetected because the site place keeping standard did not clearly define how to place keep procedure pages. Before this event, the site believed the standard for place keeping was adequate based on past successes. The vulnerability of the site to an event caused by missing a procedure page was not recognized until this event occurred. Root Cause No.2 (Organizational) Supervisory Oversight of surveillance test procedure OPSP03-SP-0006R became ineffective when the SRO stepped outside of his oversight role and became involved in the process. The SRO was clearly outside of his oversight role when he was performing DV and operating equipmeQt. Once outside of the oversight role, the SRO was no longer able to detect the error made by the test performer. The SRO performing DV and other actions to facilitate the performance of surveillance tests when more that one operator is needed has been a long standing practice. Without proper SRO Oversight, deviation from station standards such as inconsistencies with procedure place keeping went undetected and uncorrected until a human performance event occurred. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS 1. Revise OPGP03-ZA-001 0, Performing and Verifying Station Activities, to implement the Circle and Slash human performance tool designed to optimize human performance for place keeping. The tool applies to procedures and written instructions that alter system component or SUb-component configuration of the plant, primarily, but not limited to Operations, Chemistry, and Performance Testing. (. 2. Revise Conduct of Operations Chapter 2, to require the use of Circle and Slash as an additional human performance tool and human error reduction method for written instructions. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1·2001) LICENSEE EV,ENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
