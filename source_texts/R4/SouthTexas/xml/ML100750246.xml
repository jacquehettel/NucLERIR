In response to the alarms, an Equipment Clearance Order was released that had isolated the header. The number one diesel-driven fire pump was started to maintain system pressure. The fire protection main ring header was restored to service on July 8, 2008 at 0057 hours. The root cause of the inadvertent isolation of a portion of the fire protection main ring header was the general absence of adequate process controls for assessing the aggregate impact of multiple work activities on the fire protection system functionality. Corrective actions included revising procedures for establishing fire protection system functionality requirements and for establishing plant operations department administrative guidelines to provide clear guidance and direction for removal of fire protection system components and/or sections of the fire water main from service. A fire protection system owner was designated to coordinate all activities that affect system configuration. The inadvertent isolation of a portion of the fire protection main ring header adversely impacted three fire areas in Unit 2 containing redundant safe shutdown equipment. The Fire Hazards Analysis credits the availability of water suppression in these affected fire areas for safe shutdown in the event of a fire. This event resulted in no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B). The fire water supply header was inadvertently isolated to fire areas in Unit 2 where the Fire Hazards Analysis credits water suppression for the achievement of safe shutdown in the event of a fire. This condition represented an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO THE EVENT STP Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other inoperable structures, systems, or components contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT (include dates and approximate times) On July 6, 2008 at 1325 hours, an equipment clearance order (ECO) was approved in Unit 2 that removed part of the fire protection main ring header from service. On July 7, 2008 at 1929 hours, a different ECO was approved in Unit 1 that removed additional parts of the fire protection main ring header from service. On July 7,2008 at 2211 hours, both Unit 1 and Unit 2 control rooms started to receive fire detection system alarms on the fire detection computer due to reduced pressure in the isolated portion of the fire protection main ring header. In response to the alarms, Unit 1 approved release of the ECO previously approved for this Unit. The number one diesel-driven fire pump was started to maintain system pressure. The fire protection main ring header was restored to service on July 8, 2008 at 0057 hours. Subsequent investigation determined that an ECO in Unit 2 supported a different work package than the work package that was supported by the ECO in Unit 1. Although the work week management was aware that both work packages were scheduled for the same work week, work schedule reviews did not identify the aggregate impact on the fire protection main ring header functionality if both jobs were worked simultaneously. The isolation of a portion of the fire protection main ring header adversely impacted three fire areas in Unit 2 containing redundant safe shutdown equipment. No fire areas in Unit 1 containing redundant safe shutdown equipment were adversely impacted. The Fire </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) u.s.

Specifically: • Fire Area 03 is a multi-elevation area in the Mechanical/Electrical Auxiliary Building (MEAB). The analysis states that the consequence of a fire in this fire area will be mitigated by manual compensating operator action and adequate spatial separation with automatic suppression. • Fire Area 20 is a nonradioactive pipe chase located at elevation 27 foot in the MEAB. The analysis states that the consequence of a fire in this fire area will be mitigated by manual compensating operator action and adequate spatial separation with automatic suppression. • Fire Area 63 is the reactor containment building. A manually operated special hazard spray system is installed to prevent the vertical spread of a fire in containment from one safety train to another. The analysis states that the combination of protection (i.e. spray system) and separation, coupled with the low combustible concentrations, limited and controlled access, and the large containment free volume, provides protection from exposure fires and ensures the integrity of at least one pathway required for safe shutdown. E. THE METHOD OF DISCOVERY OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR PROCEDURAL OR PERSONNEL ERROR The loss of part of the fire protection main ring header was self-revealing when the fire detection computer alarmed due to reduced pressure in the isolated portion of the fire protection main ring header. II. COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURES A. FAILURE MODE, MECHANISM, AND EFFECTS OF EACH FAILED COMPONENT No component failed. The fire protection main ring header was isolated. B. CAUSE OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE Not applicable. C. SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY FAILURE OF COMPONENTS WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS Not applicable. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (lER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT A. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED No safety systems were required to respond during this event. B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY Objective evidence from the security computer door card readers (Le., to aid in determining the times that operators proceeded to hang the ECO) and the fire detection computer (Le., fire protection system parameters returned to normal) conservatively indicate that the duration of this event was three hours and ten minutes. C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS System Information: Plant fire protection systems which utilize water are supplied by an underground ring main system. The underground ring main supplies both Unit 1 and Unit 2. Redundant safe shutdown systems and components are generally compartmentalized with heavy concrete walls so that they are unlikely to be damaged from a single fire. In the cases where physical separation as a means of fire protection is not practicable, adequate detection and protection (e.g. water suppression) are installed. The STP Fire Hazards Analysis provides the safe shutdown analysis for each fire area containing safe shutdown systems and components. Risk Assessment: This event resulted in no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. The non-functional time of the removed part of the fire protection main ring header resulted in an incremental core damage probability of 3.0E-8 and an incremental large early release probability of 1.5E-9.

A re-evaluation of the event determined that the condition described in this event report represented an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety and therefore is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(8). A notification of the event pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(8) was made to NRC on January 14, 2010 at 1659 hours (Event Notification number 45631). </P></TaggedPDF-doc>
