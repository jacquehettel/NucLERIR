The de-energization of the north bus resulted in a loss of power to Standby Transformer 1,which was supplying power to the Train 1 B engineered safety features (ESF) 4160V bus. The loss of offsite power (LOOP) to the 1 B ESF bus resulted in a LOOP ESF actuation and starting the 1 B train Standby Diesel Generator and subsequent automatic actuation of 1 B safety train equipment. The direct cause was attributed to a wiring error during maintenance on 345kV switchyard circuit breaker Y530 performed by a contractor employed by the Transmission &amp; Distribution Service Provider (TDSP). The root cause of the event was insufficient management oversight and reinforcement of expectations and standards for managing switchyard activities. Corrective actions include procedure changes to better integrate TDSP activities into the STP work control process procedures and the assignment of a management owner to act as interface between STP and the TDSP regarding switchyard maintenance and other activities. There were no personnei injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage:to safety-related equipment. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT South Texas Project (STP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On September 26, 2010, South Texas Substation 345 kV circuit breaker Y530 was removed from service for planned replacement. This was the third of three scheduled breaker replacements during September and the previous two had been completed satisfactorily. The breaker replacements were performed by CenterPoint Energy (the Transmission and Distribution Service Provider) personnel and contractors. Although the work scope had been provided to the STP Switchyard Coordinator, details of the work/work packages were not provided to STP, nor discussed. On the morning of September 27, while lifting the old circuit breaker from its foundation, an associated pull box was damaged. That afternoon, the new breaker was placed on its foundation and installation·of the 345 KV connections and termination of control cables was started. On September 29, the damaged pull box was removed and replaced with an existing pull box that had been eliminated as part of the job. It was during retermination of the wires in the replaced pull box that the wiring error occurred. This wiring was associated with a current transformer for sensing a differential to protect the North switchyard. bus. Although wiring work was part of the breaker replacement process, the re-wiring of the relaying (bottom side) of the pull box was not in the original CenterPoint work plan. However, it became necessary when the pull box was damaged. The scope of this wiring work was not communicated to all appropriate personnel, and therefore, was not known to the CenterPoint Energy crew that performed the subsequent commissioning tests. Neither the STP Switchyard Coordinator nor any STP personnel were present during the timeframe the wiring error was made. The STP Switchyard Coordinator had discussed the Y530 ... ..........................._IIIIIIiIi .... .... ............ .............. .......&quot;,</TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

On September 30, 2010 at 1904, breaker Y530 was closed in on the North switchyard bus. The incorrect wiring of the current transformer resulted in a false differential condition being sensed, which cleared the North Switchyard bus. This resulted in a loss of power to Standby Transformer 1 (lockout), thus de-energizing Unit 1 1.3.8 kV Standby Bus 1G which was supplying power to the Train 1 B ESF 4160V bus. The loss of offsite power (LOOP) to the 1 B ESF bus resulted in a LOOP ESF actuation and starting the 1 ~ Standby Diesel Generator and subsequent automatic actuation of 1 B safety train equipment. At 1909, the north switchyard bus was restored by auto-closing of the north bus switchyard circuit breakers as the fault cleared. At 2211, normal power was restored to 4160V ESF Bus E 1 B, and the Standby Diesel Generator was subsequentiy secured. At 2234, breaker Y530 was closed onto the North Switchyard bus after the incorrect wiring of the subject pull box had been identified and corrected by CenterPoint switchyard personnel. At 2321, the required offsite circuit through Standby Transformer 1 was declared operable following restoration of all switchyard breakers to normal alignment and satisfactory completion of associated surveillances. On October 1, 2010, at 0035, an 8-hour notification of the event (#46298) was made to the NRC Headquarters Operations Officer in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv). E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY The clearing of the North Switchyard bus and corresponding Loss of Offsite Power ESF Actuation of the Unit 1 Train B ESF equipment due to the incorrect wiring of the Y530 circuit breaker was self-revealing when the Y530 breaker was placed in service. &quot; II. EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED The Unit 1 Train B Standby Diesel Generator automatically started due to the loss of normal offsite power to the Train B ESF bus, and all Mode II (LOOP) Train B ESF loads were sequenced on to the ESF bus as expected. Train A and Train C ESF buses remained energized by normal offsite power throughout this event, and no Train A or Train C ESF equipment actuated as a result of the loss of power to the Standby Transformer. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY No ESF equipment was inoperable as a result of this event. While the North Bus was de-energized, Action (e) of Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1, &quot;AC Electrical Power Sources&quot;, was temporarily entered due to two independent offsite circuits being inoperable (switchyard North bus and ESF bus E1 B not connected to its offsite source). Upon re-energization of the North bus approximately 5 minutes later, Action (e) was exited and Action (a) of Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1, &quot;AC Electrical Power Sources&quot;, was entered due one independent offsite circuit being inoperable. Action (a) was exited approximately 4 hours later when Standby Transformer 1 was returned to service. Unit 2 entered Tech Spec 3.8.1.1, Action (a) when the loss of the North bus occurred and exited the Action when the North bus was re-energized (duration was approximately 5 minutes.) C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT There was no·impact to radiological safety, safety of the public, or safety of station personnel for the loss of the North Switchyard Bus and subsequent Unit 1 Loss of Offsite Power ESF Actuation on Train 1 B. All safety related equipment responded as expected. The North Switchyard Bus was recovered within 5 minutes and the Standby Transformer 1 was returned to service approximately 4 hours later. A risk evaluation was performed for this event to estimate the Incremental Conditional Core Damage Probability (ICCDP) and Incremental Conditional Large Early Release Probability (ICLERP) associated with this event. A base case was analyzed for train B idle, consistent with the work week. A sensitivity case was analyzed for the North Switchyard Bus and Standby Transformer 1 de-energized (initial event conditions). The second sensitivity case analyzed was for the Standby Transformer 1 remaining de-energized (for approximately 4 hours) following the recovery of the North Switchyard bus (within 5 minutes). The base case ICCDP and ICLERP results for this event represent a small change in core damage risk and large early release risk based on the guidance contained in NRC Inspection Manual Chapters 0612 and 0609. The value for ICCDP was less than 1 E-6/ yr and the LERF value was less than 1 E-7/yr. It is reasonable to conclude that the loss of power event to the North Switchyard bus and Standby Transformer 1 had very low safety significance.

CAUSE OF THE EVENT The direct cause was attributed to a wiring error during maintenance on 345kV switchyard circuit breaker Y530 performed by a contractor employed by the Transmission &amp; Distribution Service Provider (TDSP). The root cause of the event was insufficient management oversight and reinforcement of expectations and standards for managing switchyard activities. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective actions will be implemented in accordance with the STP Corrective Action Program. 1. The switchyard management procedure will be revised to better integrate the attributes of the work process program procedure and provide more detailed instructions for utilization of the STP Switchyard Coordinator in providing oversight and directing of switchyard activities. 2. The work process program procedure and its applicable guidelines will be revised to better integrate switchyard work performed by the Transmission and Distribution Service Provider (CenterPoint). 3. A STP management owner for switchyard activities will be assigned and will act as the STPNOC management point of contact for interface with CenterPoint regarding switchyard maintenance and other activities. 4. The assigned STP management owner for switchyard activities shall implement (formalize) recurring observations and assessments of switchyard activities. V. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There have been no similar events at STP within the last three years. Unit 1 LER 2003-001 (submitted March 20, 2003) describes a partial loss of offsite power due to the loss of the North Switchyard bus; however, the cause of the 2003 event was not due to incorrect wiring during maintenance as in this Licensee Event Report. The 2003 event was caused due to the failure of the North Bus Shunt Reactor while placing it in service. The C Phase of the Shunt Reactor Circuit Switcher did not close, which set up a current imbalance in the Shunt Reactor, causing a time over-current relay to trip the North Bus circuit breakers. The exact cause of the Shunt Reactor malful'1ction could not be identified and the Shunt Reactor functioned as designed during repeat testing. VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION None. </TH></TR></Table></TaggedPDF-doc>
