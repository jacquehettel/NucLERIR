The ventilation fan is a required support system for ensuring the operability of the Train A ECW System. The ECW System provides cooling for the Train A Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Standby Diesel Generator (SDG). Therefore, the Train A ESF SDG was declared inoperable and Action b of Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1. was entered. Action b of TS 3.8.1.1 requires that with a SDG inoperable, demonstrate the operability of the TS required A.C. offsite sources by performing Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.8.1.1.1.a within 1 hour. A subsequent investigation discovered that the ECW System had been inoperable earlier than the time that the ventilation fan was initially discovered not to be running so that the performance of SR 4.8.1.1.a. was not performed within the required TS time. The inoperability of the ventilation fan occurred at 1030 hours on October 28, 2010 during calibration of the fan's high temperature switch. The root cause of this event was failure to adhere to human performance practices such as a questioning attitude and failure to adhere to the referenced procedure provided in the work instructions regarding how to perform cable terminations during implementation of a design change to install the new switch in 2005. Corrective actions include revising work instructions for calibrating the high temperature switch to verify that control power is available to start the fan circuit after the calibration is completed; add the Operating Experience of this event to the Cable Termination training class; and discussing the Operating Experience with the appropriate disciplines at the station. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1·2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition that is prohibited by Technical Specifications. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT South Texas Project (STP) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On October 28,2010 at 1235 hours, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100 per cent power, the Train A Essential Cooling Water (ECW) System was declared inoperable due to a loss of the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21A The ventilation fan is a required support system for ensuring the operability of the Train A ECW System. Unit 2 entered Action a of Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.4 which requires with only two ECW loops operable, within 7 days restore at least three loops to operable status or apply the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program, or be in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. The ECW System provides cooling for the Train A Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Standby Diesel Generator (SDG). Therefore, the Train A ESF SDG was declared inoperable and Action b of TS 3.8.1.1. was entered. At 1245 hours, all required systems, subsystems, trains, components, and devices that depend on the remaining operable SDGs as a source of emergency power were verified operable. Auxiliary Feedwater Pump 24 was also verified operable. These actions satisfied the requirements of TS 3.8.1.1.d. At approximately 1400 hours, a fuse was discovered blown in the running circuit for the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21A After the fuse was replaced, the ventilation fan restarted and checked to be satisfactorily running, the Train A ECW System and affected systems, including the Train ESF SDG, were declared operable at 1700 hours and the associated TS were exited. A subsequent review of computer data indicated that the Train A intake structure ventilation fan 21A had tripped at 1030 hours on October 28,2010. Since the fan was incapable of performing its support function, the Train A ECW System and the Train A ESF SDG had been inoperable since 1030 hours. There is no alarm indication in the control room associated with the ventilation fan. The running light for the ventilation fan is located in the control room on a control panel located behind the main control boards. Action b of TS 3.8.1.1 requires that with a SDG inoperable, demonstrate the operability of the TS required AC. offsite sources by performing surveillance requirement 4.8.1.1.1.a within 1 hour and at least once per 8 hours thereafter. This Action b requirement was not performed until 1316 </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Therefore, the requirements of Action b were not met. This is an operation or condition prohibited by the TS. On October 28, 2010, a calibration of the high temperature switch of the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21A was performed. The ventilation fan was not required to be made inoperable to calibrate the switch. The calibration activity required pulling the switch probe Grayboot connectors from a condulet in order to connect test equipment to the Grayboot connectors on the switch side. The two loose Grayboot connector ends on the line side were taped to ensure neither came in contact with the conduit to prevent the ends from grounding. Following the calibration and removal of test equipment, the tape was removed, and the switch probe was re-connected and put back in the condulet. Subsequent inspection of the Grayboot connectors found a lead from the switch, that is not used, had not been insulated where the leads were cut to length during manufacturing of the switch. This condition was not identified in the implementation of a design change in 2005 to install new the switch in the plant.lt was concluded that this lead had grounded during putting the switch probe back together following calibration and thus blowing the fuse in the running circuit of the ventilation fan. E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY The ECW intake structure ventilationfan 21A was discovered to not be running at 1235 hours on October 28, 2010 when it was noted that the fan running light was extinguished. II. EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED No safety systems were required to respond to this event. B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY Train A Essential Cooling Water (ECW) was declared inoperable due to a loss of the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21A. The following Train A safety systems were declared inoperable because the ECW System supplies cooling for these systems. • ESF SDG • Emergency Core Cooling System • Residual Heat Removal System • Component Cooling Water System • Essential Chilled Water System • Containment Spray System • Reactor Containment Fan Cooler System • Control Room Makeup and Cleanup Filtration System </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT There was no impact to radiological safety, safety of the public, or safety of station personnel during this event. The ECW System is designed to supply cooling water to various safety-related systems for normal plant operation as well as normal shutdown and during and after postulated Design Basis Accidents. The Unit 2 Train B and Train C safety systems, each supplied by their independent ECW System, were fully capable of performing their safety function during this event. For this event, the Incremental Conditional Core Damage Probability (ICCDP) was calculated to be 2.31E-10 and the Incremental Conditional Large Early Release Probability (ICLERP) was calculated to be 1.69E-11. III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The work instructions for calibrating the high temperature switch for the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21A referenced a plant procedure that provided guidance for addressing spare conductors when performing cable terminations. The instruCtions required that ends of hot spare conductors be insulated and secured. The root cause of this event was failure to adhere to human performance practices such as a questioning attitude and failure to adhere to the referenced procedure provided in the work instructions regarding how to perform cable terminations during implementation of a design change to install the new switch in 2005. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective actions will be implemented in accordance with the STP Corrective Action Program. 1. The work instructions for calibrating the high temperature switch for the ECW intake structure ventilation fan 21 A will be revised to add a step to verify that control power is available to the fan start circuit after the calibration is completed. 2. This event will be added to the Cable Termination training class as Operating Experience. 3.
