Actual inoperability of the ECW train was determined to have occurred on December 17, 2009, but was not recognized at the time. Operability was restored on December 25, 2009, when the repair was complete. Technical Specification 3.7.4.a requires that at least two ECW trains be operable while in Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4. If one ECW train is inoperable, power operation may continue provided that operability is restored within seven days, or the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program are met. Otherwise, the plant is to be in Hot Standby within the next six hours and in Cold Shutdown within the following thirty hours. Because Unit 2 ECW Train C was inoperable for eight days without taking the appropriate action required by Technical Specifications, this event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). Definitive procedural guidance for applying Generic Letter 90-05, &quot;Guidance for Performing Temporary Non-Code Repair of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 Piping,&quot; had not been provided to condition reviewers. The cause of the crack initiation could not be determined. Propagation of the crack was due to vibration in the piping resulting from throttle flow cavitation. Procedure and design changes will be applied to prevent a repeat occurrence. Only one ECW train was affected by this condition. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to other safety-related equipment. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). South Texas Project (STP) Technical Specification 3.7.4.a allows one Essential Cooling Water (ECW) loop to be inoperable for seven days while in Modes 1 through 4 before taking action to begin shutdown without extending the allowed outage time using the Configuration Risk Management Program. However, STP Unit 2 ECW Train C was determined to have been inoperable longer than the allowed outage time without taking the required action. Consequently, STP Unit 2 was in a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT STP Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On October 27, 2009, a. pinhole through-wall leak was discovered near the welded joint connecting a vent valve line to the Unit 2 Train C Component Cooling Water (CCW) heat exchanger ECW return line. The leak was initially characterized as 60 drops per minute. The leak was found to have grown to three pinhole leaks totaling 0.03 gpm on November 23, progressively growing to 0.26 gpm (one liter per minute) through ten pinhole leaks on December 21, at which point the train was shut down to prevent further degradation. A prompt operability review was requested although the train was still considered operable. Non-destructive examination on December 22 found a through-wall crack approximately 3.25 inches long at the outside diameter and 3.75 inches long at the inside diameter. The crack was near the weld in the base metal of the ECW 30&quot; diameter pipe. The critical crack length at this location is 6.1 inches. The crack propagation rate could not be defined, and it was uncertain that the ECW train could meet its 30-day mission time with this condition. Consequently, the Unit 2 ECW train C was declared inoperable at 13:11 hours on December 22, 2009. The leak was repaired, and the train was returned to service December 25, 2009. A reportability review of the condition concluded that the increased crack length used to justify the declaration of inoperability was present when photographs were taken on December 17, although they had not been widely distributed until December 21. Consequently, December 17 was taken as the date ECW Train C became inoperable. Because the ECW train was inoperable for eight days until return to service on December 25, and Technical Specification 3.7.4.a allows a single train of ECW to be inoperable for a seven-day period, the condition was reported to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1·2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

METHOD OF DISCOVERY Leakage from the vent line connection was initially identified by a Performance Technician performing fire detection system testing in Unit 2 on October 27, 2009. At the time, the leakage rate did not constitute an operability issue. II. EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED No safety systems were required to respond during this event. B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY ECW Train C was first declared inoperable on December 22, 2009. However, photographs taken on December 17, 2009, show water spraying from multiple locations around the connecting weld. A declaration of inoperability would have been appropriate at that time. The degraded area was repaired and the ECW was returned to operability on December 25, 2009. The estimated duration of inoperability is eight days. C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT Technical Specification Requirements: Technical Specification 3.7.4.a requires each ECW train to be operable in Modes 1,2,3, and 4. With one ECW train inoperable, power operation may continue provided that the inoperable train is restored to operable status within seven days or the requirements of Configuration Risk Management Program are met. Otherwise, the plant is to be in Hot Standby within the next six hours and in Cold Shutdown within the following thirty hours. Because Unit 2 ECW train C was inoperable longer than allowed under the Technical Specifications without entering the appropriate action statements, this event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). Design Description: The ECW system has three trains designed to supply cooling water to various safety-related systems for normal plant operations as well as normal shutdown and after postulated designbasis accidents. The ECW system is designed to: 1. Remove heat from plant equipment required for safe shutdown or design-basis LOCA conditions. This equipment includes: a. Component cooling water (CCW) heat exchangers b. Diesel generator (DG) heat exchangers c. Essential chiller condensers d. CCW pump supplementary coolers 2. Remove heat from certain plant equipment during normal operation. This equipment . includes: a. CCW heat exchangers b. Essential chiller condensers c. CCW pump supplementary coolers </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (1-2001) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The CCW heat exchanger, essential chiller condensers, and CCW pump supplementary cooler all reject heat to the ECW system during normal operation. Operation Mode During and After a Design Basis Accident (DBA): All three ECW loops are designed to operate initially to provide cooling for equipment required to mitigate the consequences of a DBA. There is sufficient Engineered Safety Feature equipment and cooling for mitigating the consequences of a DBA after a single failure in the ECW system. The CCW heat exchanger 2C ECW return line is a 30-inch pipe made of aluminum bronze (seamed rolled plate). The. ECW vent valve is 1 inch in diameter and made from forged aluminum bronze. Repair included removing the ECW vent valve line and applying a plug at the site of the connection on the 30-inch line. The cause of crack initiation could not be established because repair activities removed flaw site characteristics that could have provided confirmation. However, crack propagation was in response to high cycle fatigue due to vibration caused by throttle valve cavitation. Extent of Condition: As a proactive measure against similar occurrences, equivalent vent lines on remaining ECW trains in Units 1 and 2 will be removed and the ends capped. Risk Assessment: This condition contributed a very small change in core damage risk and large early release risk. The Incremental Core Damage Probability was 3.0E-7 per year, and the Incremental Large Early Release Probability was 2.2E-8 per year. Therefore, this event had very low safety&quot; significance. III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT A. Organizational Root Cause: NRC Inspection Manual Part 9900 references Generic Letter 90-05, &quot;Guidance for Performing Temporary Non-Code Repair of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 Piping,&quot; which stipulates the actions to be taken in the event of a through-wall leak. The actions were not applied to the condition in a timely manner, which otherwise could have been addressed prior to the declaration of inoperability. B. Technical Root Cause The Technical Root Cause for crack initiation cannot be determined conclusively. The Technical Root Cause for propagation of the crack is vibration resulting from cavitation occurring as the flow is throttled. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A.
