EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE) P' NO SUBMISSION DATE ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On November 3,2010, the Startup Feed Pump (SUFP) 24 was being started to support a scheduled Partial Discharge Analysis as a preventive maintenance activity. At 1021 hours the SUFP was started but then after approximately 4 seconds the pump breaker tripped open. Computer data shows that approximately 8 seconds after the pump breaker tripped the voltage on Standby Bus 2H (which supplies power to the SUFP) spiked low to near zero volts and the Unit 2 reactor tripped on Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) Undervoltage (the 2C RCP is also powered by Standby Bus 2H). Standby Diesel Generator 23 started and began supplying Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Bus E2C due to Loss of Offsite Power to the ESF bus. Standby Bus 2F experienced a momentary voltage drop of approximately 1 second (Standby Buses 2F and 2H are both fed by the X winding of the Unit 2 Auxiliary Transformer) resulting in some A train loads being secured. Following the reactor trip, the plant was stabilized in MODE 3 at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature. At 1038 hours an Unusual Event was declared for Unit 2 due to the breaker cubicle explosion associated with the SUFP breaker failure (ENS Event Number 46387). The breaker malfunction did not result in a fire. The Unusual Event was terminated at 1240 hours when the plant was stabilized in MODE 3. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. This LER is the planned LER supplement described in Revision 1 including a correction to the reporting criteria where criterion 20.2203(a)(3)(i) was inadvertently checked. This LER supplement provides the results of the respective Root Cause Evaluation and revises the appropriate reporting criteria accordingly.

REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT South Texas Project (STP) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On November 3, 2010, the Startup Feed Pump (SUFP) 24 was being started to support a scheduled Partial Discharge Analysis as a preventive maintenance activity. Following the pre-job brief, a Licensed Operator Training (LOT) Trainee made a plant announcement and then placed the hand switch to Start at 1021 hours. The SUFP started but then after approximately 4 seconds the pump breaker tripped open. Computer data shows that approximately 8 seconds after the pump breaker tripped the voltage on Standby Bus 2H (which supplies power to the SUFP) spiked low to near zero volts and the Unit 2 reactor tripped on Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) Undervoltage (the 2C RCP is also powered by Standby Bus 2H). Standby Diesel Generator (SDG) 23 started and began supplying Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Bus E2C due to Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP) to the ESF bus. Standby Bus 2F experienced a momentary voltage drop of approximately 1 second duration (Standby Buses 2F and 2H are both fed by the X winding of the Unit 2 Auxiliary Transformer) resulting in some A train loads being secured, however the low voltage condition cleared on Bus 2F prior to the point at which associated time delay relays would have started Standby Diesel Generator 21 (ESF Train A). Following the reactor trip, the plant was stabilized in MODE 3 at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature. At 1038 hours an Unusual Event was declared for Unit 2 due to the breaker cubicle explosion associated with the SUFP breaker failure (ENS Event Number 46387). The breaker malfunction did not result in a fire. The Unusual Event was terminated at 1240 hours when the plant was stabilized in MODE 3. An Operator in the Turbine Generator Building (TGB) reported substantial damage had occurred to the SUFP Breaker. The front door and access panels for Cubicle 1A in 13.8 KV Standby Bus 2H had been blown open or deformed. </TH></TR><Caption><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Caption></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A 	LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Most of the relay flags were probably caused by </P><P>shock/vibration from the breaker explosion except for the 86 Lockout Relay, which requires rotary </P><P>motion to actuate. It is unclear whether the 86 Lockout Relay was actuated by shock/vibration </P><P>causing one of the associated protective relays (50/51,51 G, 87,46) to momentarily close an output </P><P>contact resulting in the electrical actuation of the 86 relay or whether the 86 relay was actuated </P><P>when one or more of the protective relays was actuated by a valid signal. </P><P>The three arc chute assemblies (one per phase) showed signs of damage and were dark with </P><P>black soot. The three blow-out coil return straps showed substantial damage. These straps are </P><P>approximately 1 inch wide by 1/8 inch thick. When a breaker trips and the contacts open to </P><P>interrupt the current, the resulting arcs from the arcing contacts transfer to the blow-out coil </P><P>assembly, which includes the blow-out coil return straps. The coils produce a magnetic field </P><P>which helps to push the arcs into the arc chutes where the arcs are dissipated and cooled. The </P><P>three return straps had each been melted through which indicates multiple arcs had existed </P><P>across the breaker contacts during the event. </P><P>E.

SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT There was no impact to radiological safety, safety of the public, or safety of station personnel during this event. The Incremental Conditional Core Damage Probability (ICCDP) for the Reactor Trip in Unit 2 on November 3, 2010 is 2.82E-07. The resulting Incremental Conditional Large Early Release Probability (LERP) given a turbine trip is 7.21 E-09. III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The root cause of the breaker failure in 13.8 KV Standby Switchgear 2H / Cubicle 1 A (SUFP 24) and the resulting Unit 2 reactor trip is that the arc ·failed to extinguish when the breaker opened due to moisture induced contamination shorting out the arc runner spacer between the first and second blowout coils in the upper arc chute assembly. This caused the arc current to bypass the second coil rather than running through the coil so a magnetic field was not created in the second coil that would have driven the arc further into the arc chute. This caused damage to the arc chutes and caused plasma (Le., ionized air) in the cubicle. Eventually the plasma caused a conduction path in the cubicle for the three phases to ground. The grounding of the three phases caused the voltage on the associated buses to drop to zero and resulted in an explosion (pressure wave) that caused physical damage to the cubicle. The voltage drop caused the Unit 2 reactor to trip on Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) undervoltage. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS 1. Revise Preventive Maintenance (PMs) for the 13.8 KV and 4160 V breakers to: (1) Include AC Hi-Pot testing of the whole breaker including arc chutes; (2) Include resistance measurements of the whole arc path through the arc runners and blowout coils [Digital Low Resistance Ohm (DLRO) or ductor testing]; (3) Specify that velocity testing of the breaker opening is preferred over the currently performed speed testing. (4) Perform &quot;as found&quot; velocity or speed testing at the beginning of the PMs rather than just performing the tests at the end of the PMs. 2. Revise procedures OPMP05-NA-0001 , OPMP05-NA-0005, and OPMP05-NA-0009 to include the following: (1) Address and match the changes made to the 13.8 KV and 4160 V PMs (as discussed above); (2) Ensure that the DLRO/ductor testing includes the whole arc path through the arc runners and blowout coils [currently just checks resistance of breaker contacts]; </TH></TR><Caption><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Caption></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION' SHEET u.s.
