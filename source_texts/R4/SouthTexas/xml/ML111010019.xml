At 1021 hours the SUFP was started but then after approximately 4 seconds the pump breaker tripped open. Computer data shows that approximately 8 seconds after the pump breaker tripped the voltage on Standby Bus 2H (which supplies power to the SUFP) spiked low to near zero volts and the Unit 2 reactor tripped on Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) Undervoltage (the 2C RCP is also powered by Standby Bus 2H). Standby Diesel Generator 23 started and began supplying Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Bus E2C due to Loss of Offsite Power to the ESF bus, Standby Bus 2F experienced a momentary voltage drop of approximately 1 second (Standby Buses 2F and 2H are both fed by the X winding of the Unit 2 Auxiliary Transformer) resulting in some A train loads being secured. Following the reactor trip, the plant was stabilized in MODE 3 at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature. At 1038 hours an Unusual Event was declared for Unit 2 due to the breaker cubicle explosion associated with the SUFP breaker failure (ENS Event Number 46387). The breaker malfunction did not result in a fire. The Unusual Event was terminated at 1240 hours when the plant was stabilized in MODE 3, There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment. Per Revision 0 of this LER, a planned supplement was scheduled to be submitted no later than on April 4, 2011 based on the completion of the root cause evaluation including the event failure analysis. Since the failure analysis of the event is still under review, an additional planned Supplemental LER will be submitted as indicated above. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT South Texas Project (STP) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On November 3, 2010, the Startup Feed Pump (SUFP) 24 was being started to support a scheduled Partial Discharge Analysis as a preventive maintenance activity. Following the pre-job brief, a Licensed Operator Training (LOT) Trainee made a plant announcement and then placed the hand switch to Start at 1021 hours. The SUFP started but then after approximately 4 seconds the pump breaker tripped open. Computer data shows that approximately 8 seconds after the pump breaker tripped the voltage on Standby Bus 2H (which supplies power to the SUFP) spiked low to near zero volts and the Unit 2 reactor tripped on Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) Undervoltage (the 2C RCP is also powered by Standby Bus 2H). Standby Diesel Generator (SDG) 23 started and began supplying Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Bus E2C due to Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP) to the ESF bus. Standby Bus 2F experienced a momentary voltage drop of approximately 1 second duration (Standby Buses 2F and 2H are both fed by the X winding of the Unit 2 Auxiliary Transformer) resulting in some A train loads being secured, however the low voltage condition cleared on Bus 2F prior to the point at which associated time delay relays would have started Standby Diesel Generator 21 (ESF Train A). Following the reactor trip, the plant was stabilized in MODE 3 at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature. At 1038 hours an Unusual Event was declared for Unit 2 due to the breaker cubicle explosion associated with the SUFP breaker failure (ENS Event Number 46387). The breaker malfunction did not result in a fire. The Unusual Event was terminated at 1240 hours when the plant was stabilized in MODE 3. An Operator in the Turbine Generator Building (TGB) reported substantial damage had occurred to the SUFP Breaker. The front door and access panels for Cubicle 1A in 13.8 KV Standby Bus 2H had been blown open or deformed. All protective relay's red flags were actuated on the SUFP motor breaker cubicle except for the </TH></TR><Caption><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Caption></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A 	LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

NO NUMBER </P><P>30F4</P><P>06000499</P><P>South Texas Unit 2 </P><P>2010 005 01 </P><P>lower unit of the 46 current balance relay. Most of the relay flags were probably caused by </P><P>shock/vibration from the breaker explosion except for the 86 Lock.~·ut Relay, which requires rotary </P><P>motion to actuate. It is unclear whether the 86 Lockout Rel.~'Y was actuated by shock/vibration </P><P>causing one of the associated protective relays (50/51., '31 G, 87, 46) to momentarily close an output </P><P>contact resulting in the electrical actuation of the ti6 relay or whether the 86 relay was actuated </P><P>when one or more of the protective relays was actuated by a valid signal. </P><P>The three arc chute assemblies (onG per phase) showed signs of damage and were dark with </P><P>black soot. The three blow-out Coil return straps showed substantial damage. These straps are </P><P>approximately 1 inch wide by 1/8 inch thick. When a breaker trips and the contacts open to </P><P>interrupt the current, the resulting arcs from the arcing contacts transfer to the blow-out coil </P><P>assembly, which includes the blow-out coil return straps. The coils produce a magnetic field </P><P>which helps to push the arcs into the arc chutes where the arcs are dissipated and cooled. The </P><P>three return straps had each been melted through which indicates multiple arcs had existed </P><P>across the breaker contacts during the event. </P><P>E.
