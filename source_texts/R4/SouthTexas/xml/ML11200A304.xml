In support of a planned evolution to transfer water from the 1 B Recycle Holdup Tank (RHT) to the Volume Control Tank, a Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) assigned to review atypical plant conditions during the outage identified a potential dilution source that was not included in the plant surveillance procedure used to confirm compliance with Technical Specification 3.4.1.4.2 regarding unborated water sources. Although the valves were not secured closed as required by TS, the valves were closed and no dilution occurred. Technical Specifications were revised in 2003 to remove references to specific valves required to be isolated with respect to unborated water sources and replaced with more generic language. However, the impact of using the RHT as a fill source was not adequately addressed with respect to compliance with the new TS requirements, and thus the surveillance procedure used to ensure compliance did not address all unborated water sources. The corrective action will be to revise the plant surveillance procedure used to ensure compliance with TS 3.4.1.4.2 and TS 3.9.1 to reflect the additional valves that must be secured in the closed position to comply with the TS. This corrective action will be implemented in accordance with the STP Corrective Action Program. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related equipment associated with this event. This event did not have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition that was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. B. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO EVENT South Texas Project (STP) Unit 1 was in Mode 5, with Reactor Coolant System loops not filled, as part of refueling outage 1 RE 16. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT No structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed . to the event. D. NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT On April 30, 2011, STP Unit 1 was in refueling outage 1 RE16, with the unit in Mode 5, Reactor Coolant System loops not filled. In support of a planned evolution to transfer water from the Boron Recycle System (BRS) 1 B Recycle Holdup Tank (RHT) to the Volume Control Tank, a Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) assigned to review atypical plant conditions during the outage identified a potential unborated water source that was not included in the plant surveillance procedure used to confirm compliance with Technical Specifications 3.4.1.4.2 regarding unborated water sources. Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.1.4.2 (Reactor Coolant System -Cold Shutdown -Loops not Filled) requires in Mode 5 that &quot;Each valve or mechanical joint used to isolate unborated water sources shall be secured in the closed position.&quot; Note that a similar requirement in TS 3.9.1 (Refueling Operations -Boron Concentration) applies during Mode 6. The associated surveillance procedure was focused on systems directly coupled to the Chemical and Volume Control System, such as Reactor Makeup Water (RMW), where an opened valve can reduce the RCS boron concentration by the addition of unborated water. The SRO review revealed that transferring water from the RHT to refill the RCS loops indirectly exposed the RCS to unborated water via Demineralized Water (DW) connected to the BRS. The surveillance procedure did not ensure that the connecting valves between the RHT and the DW system were secured closed. Although the valves were not secured closed as required by TS, the valves were closed and no dilution occurred. E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY The non-compliance with Technical Specifications was discovered during Senior Reactor Operator review of planned refueling outage activities. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED N/A B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY N/A C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT The STP at-power risk model cannot be used to obtain either core damage frequency (CDF) or large early release frequency (LERF) data for this event (there is no PRA evaluation of boron dilution during shutdown). However, since the valves of concern in the potential unborated water path were not opened, and no dilution occurred, the potential impact to CDF and LERF from this event is negligible and the event is considered to be of low safety significance. III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT In 1997, STP procedures were revised to allow using water from the RHT to refill the RCS loops in addition to using the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) or the Boric Acid Tanks (BATs). Prior to this, only the RWST or BATs were used for RCS refill. This change allowed clean, hydrazine-treated, borated water from the RHT to be used as a water source to refill the RCS during a refueling outage. In 2003, Technical Specifications 3.4.1.4.2 and 3.9.1 were revised to remove references to specific valves that were required to be secured to protect against dilution and replaced with the more generic language discussed in Section I.D above. However, the potential consequences of using the RHT as a fill source was not adequately addressed with respect to compliance with the revised TS requirements, and thus the surveillance procedure used to ensure compliance did not address all potential unborated water sources. IV. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The surveillance procedure used to ensure compliance with TS 3.4.1.4.2 and 3.9.1 requirements will be revised to reflect the additional valves that must be secured in the closed position to comply with the TS. (Targeted due date September 30,2011). Tracking and implementation of this action will be controlled in accordance with the STP Corrective Action Program. </TH></TR><Caption><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Caption></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.
