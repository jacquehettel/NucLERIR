Per the Integrated Computer System (ICS), Class 1E 4.16 kV ESF Bus E2B was inoperable longer than allowed by Technical Specifications. The associated ESF buses were inoperable longer than allowed by Technical Specifications_ Therefore, this condition is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. The Root Causes are: 1) the range of voltage allowed by the bandwidth of the Load Tap Changers (LTC) on the Unit Auxiliary Transformer and the ESF B Transformers was not conservatively modeled; 2) The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the ESF Transformer LTC was inadequate; and 3)Management oversight did not have a method to identify, classify, control and monitor highly complex modifications. The associated corrective actions are as follows: 1) Develop and issue an electrical design calculation methodology guideline or procedure; 2) Develop and issue a guideline or a procedure for completing a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis and 3) Define complex modifications in the design change procedure including defining the requirements for management oversight over providing adequate resources, development of project schedules, and ensuring site involvement in reviews of project documents. There were no personnel injuries, no offsite radiological releases, and no damage to safety-related eqUipment associated with this condition. This condition did not have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><P>1. FACILITY NAME </P><P>2. DOCKET </P><P>6. LER NUMBER </P><P>3.

STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT </P><P>No structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. </P><P>D. 	NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT </P><P>On May 14, 2011, during the weekly performance of the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) power </P><P>availability surveillance, B Train 480 Volt ESF Load Centers (LC) E2B1 and E2B2 were found with </P><P>local indication for voltage at 520 Volts which exceeds the surveillance acceptance criterion of a </P><P>maximum allowed bus voltage of 506 volts. </P><P>Based on the failed surveillance, the Class 1 E 4160V Bus 2B was declared INOPERABLE at 21 :32. The following Technical Specification action statements were entered: </P><L><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>TS 3.8.3.1 action a was entered requiring re-energizing the associated bus within 8 hours or apply the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP) or be in at least HOT STANDBY in the next 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• 	</LI_Label><LI_Title>TS 3.8.1.1 ACTION a was entered which requires demonstration of the OPERABILITY of the remaining A.C. sources by performing Surveillance Requirement 4.8.1.9.1.a within 1 hour and at least once per 8 hours thereafter, within 72 hours restore the oftsite circuit to OPERABLE status or apply the requirements of the CRMP, or be in at least HOT SHUTDOWN within the next 12 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 24 hours. </LI_Title></LI></L><P>On 05/15/11 13:26, the ESF Transformer 2B Load Tap Changer was placed in manual per plant procedures and lowered bus voltage. </P><P>On 05/15/11 15:21, the 4160 V BUS E2B was declared OPERABLE after adjusting both 4160 V E2B voltage and 480 V LC E2B voltage to within specified bands.

YEAR i SEQUENTIAL j REV. NO South Texas Unit 2 05000499 , NUMBER I 3 OF 4 2011 001 00 </Figure><P>Per Integrated Computer System (ICS) data, Class1 E 4160 V ESF Bus E2B downstream 480 Volt </P><P>Load Center Buses E2B1 and E2B2 were inoperable from approximately 06:15 on May 5 to </P><P>approximately 06:15 on May 7 and from approximately 09:00 on May 8 to approximately 13:30 on </P><P>May 15. </P><P>Since there is firm evidence that the associated ESF buses were inoperable longer than the allowed Technical Specification action statement duration of eight hours including the 6 hour requirement to be in HOT STANDBY, this is considered a condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. </P><P>E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY </P><P>The over-voltage condition was discovered by reviewing the local voltage indicators during </P><P>the weekly performance of ESF Power Availability surveillance. </P><P>II. EVENT-DRIVEN INFORMATION </P><P>A. SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT RESPONDED </P><P>N/A </P><P>B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM INOPERABILITY </P><P>Per the ICS, Class 1 E 4.16 kV ESF Bus E2B and downstream 480 Volt Load Center Buses E2B1 and E2B2 were inoperable from approximately: </P><L><LI><LI_Label>• </LI_Label><LI_Title>06: 15 on May 5 to approximately 06: 15 on May 7 </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• </LI_Label><LI_Title>09:00 on May 8 to approximately 13:30 on May 15 </LI_Title></LI></L><P>C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT </P><P>Per engineering evaluation, there is reasonable assurance that the condition would not have </P><P>prevented the affected safety-related switchgear and associated loads from performing their safety </P><P>functions. Therefore, any increase in Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release Frequency </P><P>was insignificant. Consequently, there is no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public. </P><P>III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT </P><L><LI><LI_Label>1. </LI_Label><LI_Title>The range of voltage values allowed by the bandwidth of the Load Tap Changers (LTC) on the Unit Auxiliary Transformer and the ESF B Transformers was not conservatively modeled. An electrical setpoint methodology for modeling L TCs did not exist at STP resulting in knowledge-based task performance by the user and reviewer. Program inputs/assumptions used in the computerized Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) Calculation are not clear and were not adequately documented which impeded the capability to review the calculation. </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>2. </LI_Label><LI_Title>Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the ESF transformer LTC did not accurately identify the severity of all failure effects, and did not conclude that the method of failure detection was inadequate. An adequate FMEA would have identified the need for instrumentation and alarms. Full understanding of the potential failure modes would have identified the potential voltage range in which the LTC could fail and would have determined the voltage limits on the 480V bus could be exceeded. </LI_Title></LI></L><P>CONTINUATION SHEET </P><P>6.
