From 12/12/10 through12/1212013 there were six occurrences ofreactor pressure &lt; 0 psig. The Reactor Pressureffemperature curves in the GGNS Pressure and Temperature Limit Report (PTLR) have a minimum pressure value of0 psig referenced on the curve. The lowest pressure noted in the six occurrences was approximately -9.9 psig on December 13, 2012. All systems performed per design during the reactor startups with RPV pressure below 0 psig during the past 3 years. The cause ofnot entering LCO 3.4.11 was the condition was procedurally allowed and aligned with Operations training. There were no adverse effects on the health or safety ofthe public as a result ofthese events. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (01-2014) NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH><TH>APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150~104 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

REPORTABLE OCCURRENCE This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being submitted pursuant to Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) SO.73(a) (2)(i)(B) for an operation or condition which was prohibited by Technical Specifications by not entering Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.4.11, RCS Pressure and Temperature (PIT) Limits during six Reactor startups with Reactor Pressure Vessel (EIIS:RPV) steam pressure below zero (0) pounds per square inch gage (psig). B.INITIAL CONDITIONS At the time of discovery ofthe issue, the reactor was in operational mode one with reactor power at 100 percent. There were no additional inoperable structures, systems, or components at the time of discovery that contributed to this event. This event is considered a discovery of an existing but previously unrecognized condition. C. DESCRIPTION OF OCCURRENCE On December 12, 2013, Grand Gulf Nuclear Station discovered a previously unrecognized failure to enter LCO 3.4.11 when Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) pressure dropped below zero psig during six reactor startups. The plant was operating in Mode lat 100 percent thermal power during discovery. All systems performed per design. D. APPARENT CAUSE The cause ofthe failure to enter the LCO was the condition was procedurally allowed and aligned with training Operations personnel had received. Therefore, RPV being below 0 psig was not recognized to be a condition that required entry into the LCO. Integrated Operating Instruction (101) 03-1-01-1 was revised in 1994 to allow startup with a vacuum in the reactor vessel because opening Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) with pressure in the reactor vessel can cause a rapid drop in level. The current 101 03-1-01-1 contains a note as follows: &quot;IF vacuum is NOT desired on Reactor Vessel, THEN INBOARD MSIVs AND drain Valves, lB21-F016 AND lB21-F019, May be left closed.&quot; E. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective Action issued to revise the GGNS Pressure and Temperature Limit Report (PTLR) to address having vacuum in the reactor vessel (below 0 on PTLR curve). Interim corrective action issued to ensure negative pressure is not applied to reactor pressure vessel until PTLR is revised. Corrective Action has also been issued to revise Operator Training. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT The six events posed no threat to public health and safety as the RPV performed as designed. All safety systems performed as designed. The six events did not challenge any design or safety limit. Nuclear safety was not significantly compromised because the negative (vacuum) internal pressures identified do not cause any concerns with applicable material stresses or analysis for the GGNS RPV. GGNS remained being operated in an analyzed condition and within established margins in regards to brittle fracture ofthe RPV ferritic materials. There are no known or understood safety significance issues created by allowing the RPV to have a relatively small vacuum ofapproximately -9.9 to -6 psig during startup with the RPV metal temperatures being at approximately 160 Fahrenheit (OF) to 170°F. There is reasonable assurance that operating below 0 psig on the pressure/temperature (PIT) curves is acceptable. The PTLR is set for the limiting components which are nozzle welds for the RPV inlet. These locations get compressive and tensile stresses during startup and shutdown, but the vacuum in the steam region had an immeasurable effect on these limiting locations. The locations were still under pressure from the static fluid head (just less pressure due to being at vacuum). Therefore, margin remained. During the six events, no Technical Specification defined Safety Limits were challenged. Radiological Safety was not affected since there was no radiological release to the public during the events. There was no impact to the safety ofthe public, industrial safety or radiological safety as a result ofthese events. G. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION There have been no indications of RPV brittle fracture in the past 3 years due to the cause documented in this LER. There have been no identified failures to enter an Leo due to inadequate procedure or training in the past 3 years. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
