EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE N/A N/A ABSTRACT (Umit to i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) on 201 Gulf an unexpected Reactor SCRAM from 1000/0 thermal power due to high reactor pressure detected by the Reactor Protection System. Operations staff immediately entered the appropriate off-normal event procedures. Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) initiated and injected briefly during the transient. The RCIC initiation signal was valid, but not required to maintain the reactor vessel water level. Reactor levels were verified and RCIC was subsequently secured. All other systems operated as expected. Reactor pressure was controlled by discharging steam to the main condenser via the main turbine bypass valves. Reactor water level was controlled using the condensate and feedwater systems via the startup level control valve. No safety relief valves actuated. The cause of the SCRAM was a human performance-induced error due to inadequate troubleshooting activities on the Turbine A was not recognized nor corrected, thereby resulting in a false high turbine stress temperature signal. Upon restoration of the TSE, the incorrect Signal forced turbine control valves in the closed direction and resulted in a high reactor pressure transient. Procedures and work orders are being revised to prevent recurrence of this event. There were no adverse effects to the health and safety of the public. </Figure><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

REPORTABLE OCCURRENCE </P><P>This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being submitted pursuant to Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (EIIS:JC) (RPS) and unplanned initiation of the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (EIIS:BN) (RCIC) system. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Headquarters Operations Center was notified by phone on July 30, 2013, within 4 hours of the event pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) for the RPS actuation and within 8 hours of the event pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for initiation of RCIC during the initial transient </P><P>B. INITIAL CONDITIONS </P><P>At the time of the event the reactor was in Mode 1 with reactor power at 100 percent </P><P>thermal power. Failure of the Turbine Stress Evaluator (EIIS:23) (TSE) 1 N30N011 B </P><P>Temperature Transmitter (EIIS:TI) was an unknown condition prior to the SCRAM. </P><P>C.

RCIC initiation was valid, but not required to maintain reactor water level </P><P>as reactor feedwater (EIIS:SJ) was in service and operating properly. Reactor level was </P><P>verified and RCIC was subsequently secured. All other systems operated as expected. </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/ML13273A354_img_3.jpg"/>CONTINUATION SHEET 1.

CAUSE The cause of the SCRAM was a human performance-induced error due to inadequate troubleshooting activities on the Turbine Stress Evaluator (TSE). In response to a &quot;TSE STU Cab Failure&quot; alarm, Grand Gulf maintenance staff assumed that the alpha channel transmitter (1 N30N011A) was the cause. Maintenance staff were pre-conditioned this assumption based on recent TSE maintenance which revealed that the alpha channel transmitter was degraded but functional. That assumption was not validated through proper troubleshooting at the time of discovery. A failure mode analysis performed subsequent to this event identified that the bravo channel transmitter (1 N30N011 8) was the true failed component. Consequently, maintenance staff restored the TSE without the failure being repaired. Upon restoration, the TSE detected a 100% mismatch between the reference temperature signal and the actual steady-state full power temperature signal. The turbine control system responded, as designed, by stroking the turbine control valves in the closed direction. Reactor pressure increased to the RPS actuation setpoint. No situational or time pressures were identified that contributed to the event. The cause of the automatic RCIC initiation was reactor water level decrease immediately following the SCRAM. E. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The following corrective action to prevent recurrence was completed: Revised model work orders 50025957, 50025958, and 50025959 for Preventative Maintenances 11A, 118, and 12, respectively, to include restoration steps from the ARL The following corrective actions to prevent recurrence will be performed: Revise Standard Operating Instruction (SOl) 04-1-01-N32-2, &quot;Turbine Generator Control&quot; to include a new step with instructions on how to turn the TSE on and off; and revise the Annunciator Response Instruction (ARI) to refer to SOl 04-1-01-N32-2 for instructions on turning the TSE on and off. Revise procedure 02-S-01-41 &quot;On Line Risk Assessment&quot; to include the Activity Evaluation Checklist (attached to CA 18) for Low and Normal Risk Emergent Activities. Checklist shall include a PEER review by one of the following: Maintenance Manager, Work Week Manager or Shift Manager prior to the beginning of any emergent activity. Include prOVisions to ensure: the proper level of troubleshooting is performed per ENMA-125 &quot;Troubleshooting Control of Maintenance Activities, the 01-S-17-42 &quot;Trip </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

F. SAFETY ASSESSMENT The event posed no threat to public health and safety as the RPS performed as designed. All safety systems responded as designed. The SCRAM signal was from reactor high pressure on channels Band C. Plots of Main Turbine Control Valve and bypass valve positions indicate that the Main Turbine Control Valves closed as the bypass valves opened to maintain reactor pressure as designed. When the bypass valves reached full open, the control valves were continuing to close, which caused a corresponding increase in reactor pressure to the reactor high pressure SCRAM set point. As a result, an automatic SCRAM occurred due to a High Reactor Pressure of 1065 psig. All control rods inserted as designed. There were no actuations of safety relief valves during this event. The highest observed reactor pressure of 1065 psig is bounded by the existing analyzed event in the GGNS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Section 15.2. At no event were any Technical Specification Safety Limits '.. .1 .L .J or challenged. There were no Emergency Core Cooling System actuations or malfunctions. Immediate actions performed by the Operations staff were adequate and appropriate in placing and maintaining the reactor in a safe shutdown condition. Nuclear safety was not compromised because safety-related equipment performed their safety functions. Radiological safety was not affected, as there was no radiological I .1 during the event. The response of the crew did not challenge established industrial safety protocols or requirements. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public, industrial safety, or radiological safety as a result of this event. G. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Condition Report (CR) CR-GGN-2013-4969 documents the unplanned RCIC initiation. The 1 N30N011 B transmitter is model number 315 from ABB. Within the past 2 years, there were no similar events (Le., SCRAM or RCIC initiation as a result of inadequate troubleshooting). </TH></TR></Table></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
