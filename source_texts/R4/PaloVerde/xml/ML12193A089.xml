An automatic control element drive mechanism timer module (ACTM) was installed on each control element drive mechanism (CEDM) during the refueling outage to minimize the occurrence of slipped or dropped control element assemblies (CEAs) resulting from CEDM or control system (CEDMCS) abnormalities. Regulating CEA group 1 was being inserted during a reactor coolant system (RCS) boron dilution test directed by the LPPT procedure. During the insertion, the ACTM for CEA 57 stopped movement of the CEA and actuated related alarms. Control room staff stopped insertion of regulating CEA group 1 and RCS dilution. Power increased, approaching the LPPT procedural limit of 0.5% power because of the residual RCS dilution effect. The control room staff manually tripped the reactor to comply with the procedural power limit. The LPPT procedure did not provide contingency direction to insert other CEA groups to compensate for the RCS dilution. ~he root cause investigation is in progress. In response to the event, the LPPT procedure was revised to provide contingency direction to insert regulating CEA group 5 in the event planned CEA insertion could not continue during the test. Similar events have not occurred in the prior three years. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></TaggedPDF-doc>
