    <abstract> On May 5, 2011, at approximately 01 :53, Unit 2 was in Mode 3 and preparing for entry
        into Mode 2 at the completion of its 16th refueling outage. Prior to Mode 2 entry, the
        Channel A setpoint for Steam Generator (SG) #1 Low Pressure (SGLP) Reactor Trip and Main
        Steam Isolation Signal (MSIS) was found to be 950.4 pounds per square inch absolute (psia),
        which is below the allowable value, greater than or equal to 955 psia, required by Technical
        Specifications (TSs) 3.3.2 and 3.3.5 for the reactor trip channel and the MSIS channel,
        respectively. The setpoint for those channels had been at the discovered value since
        approximately the time Unit 2 had reached normal operating temperature on May 2, 2011. Upon
        identification, SG #1 SGLP Channel A was placed into bypass as required by the TSs.
        Subsequently, the SGLP setpoint was adjusted to a value above 955 psia, the channel was
        taken out of bypass, and was declared operable at 17: 19 on May 5, 2011. The cause of the
        event was procedural inadequacies. Station procedures did not require verification of SGLP
        bistable setpoints after completion of outage activities and prior to plant conditions
        requiring them to be OPERABLE in Mode 3. Corrective actions included the establishment of
        procedure requirements to verify the plant protection system variable setpoints prior to
        plant conditions requiring them to be OPERABLE. Similar reportable events have not occurred
        within the last three years. </abstract>
