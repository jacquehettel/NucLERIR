An automatic control element drive mechanism timer module (ACTM) was installed on each control element drive mechanism (CEDM) during the refueling outage to minimize the occurrence of slipped or dropped control element assemblies (CEAs) resulting from CEDM or control system (CEDMCS) abnormalities. Regulating CEA group 1 was being inserted during a reactor coolant system (RCS) boron dilution test directed by the LPPT procedure. During the insertion, the ACTM for CEA 57 stopped movement of the CEA and actuated related alarms. Control room staff stopped insertion of regulating CEA group 1 and RCS dilution. Power increased, approaching the LPPT procedural limit of 0.5% power because of the residual RCS dilution effect. The control room staff manually ripped the reactor to comply with the procedural power limit. The LPPT procedure did not provide contingency direction to insert other CEA groups to compensate for the RCS dilution. ~he root cause investigation is in progress. In response to the event, the LPPT procedure was revised to provide contingency direction to insert regulating CEA group 5 in the event planned CEA insertion could not continue during the test. Similar events have not occurred in the prior three years. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 361iA COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.S.

REPORTING REQUIREMENT(S): This LER is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A) to report a manual actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS)(EIIS: JC) that occurred while the reactor was critical. This event was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on April 15, 2012, via the event notification system report number 47837. 2. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S) AND COMPONENT(S): The control element drive mechanism control system (CEDMCS) (EllS: AA) provides control signals and motive power to the coils of the magnetic jacks in the 89 control element drive mechanisms (CEDMs) (EllS: AA) which move, hold, and release the control element assemblies (CEAs) (EllS: AA). The CEAs absorb neutrons to control reactivity. Two motor/generator sets are connected in parallel to supply 240 VAC, 3 phase power through the reactor trip switchgear (RTSG) (EllS: AA). The output from the RTSG is directed through power switch assemblies. The power switch assemblies contain silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) which convert the 3 phase, AC input voltage to a stepped DC output voltage. The conversion is controlled by electronic circuits in the power switch assembly and in the CEDMCS subgroup logic housing. These control circuits determine </TH></TR></Table><P>the sequence to supply power to the CEDM coils. </P><P>The control circuits for each CEA were modified during the Unit 3 refueling outage which commenced in March, 2012. Part of the modification included replacement of CEA timer cards with automatic CEDM timer modules (ACTMs). The ACTM controls the sequencing of the coil voltages to the CEDM and monitors for CEDMCS abnormalities such as inadequate holding currents and high coil currents. The ACTM initiates rapid automatic action to hold the CEA in position, and generates alarms both locally and in the Control Room in response to slight variations from expected values for monitored conditions. These automatic actions minimize the occurrence of dropped or slipped CEAs. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.s.

Shutdown is accomplished by either manual or automatic generation of reactor trip signals. The trip signals open the RTSG breakers, which de-energize the CEDM coils and allow all CEAs to drop into the core by the force of gravity. </P><P>Low power physics testing (LPPT) is conducted during Mod~ 2 following refueling </P><P>outages to verify reactor core operating characteristics are consistent with design </P><P>predictions and to provide assurance the core can be operated as designed. </P><P>3. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: </P><P>On April 15, 2012, Palo Verde Unit 3 was in Mode 2 (Start-up). The reactor was critical and </P><P>post-refueling low power physics testing was in progress. Reactor power was below the </P><P>point-of-adding-heat (0.005 -0.1 % power) and the reactor coolant system (RCS) was at </P><P>normal operating temperature and normal operating pressure. There were no other </P><P>structures, systems, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to </P><P>the event. </P><P>4. EVENT DESCRIPTION: </P><P>During LPPT on April 15, at 11 :25, a dilution of RCS boron concentration began at a rate of 80 </P><P>gallons per minute in support of the testing. As directed by the LPPT procedure, regulating </P><P>CEA group 3 was inserted to offset the dilution and keep reactor power level constant. </P><P>Regulating CEA group 1 insertion commenced after regulating CEA group 3 had been inserted </P><P>to the lower group stop position, approximately 5 inches withdrawn. </P><P>At 12: 13, while inserting CEA regulating group 1 , CEA 57 deviated from its sub-group when it </P><P>stopped moving. The &quot;CEA Group 1 Minor Deviation&quot; alarm was received and CEA regulating </P><P>group 1 insertion and the RCS dilution were stopped; however, the residual positive reactivity </P><P>in the core resulted in a reactor power increase which approached the power limits (0.5%) set </P><P>forth in the LPPT procedure. The LPPT procedure did not provide contingency direction to </P><P>insert other CEA groups to compensate for the RCS dilution.

Plant systems operated as expected, and this event was diagnosed as an uncomplicated reactor trip. Safety related busses remained energized from offsite power during the event and the offsite power grid was stable. Unit 3 was stabilized in Mode 3 feeding Steam Generators with the non-essential auxiliary feedwater pump. </P><P>5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES: </P><P>This condition did not adversely affect plant safety or the health and safety of the public. This event did not result in a transient more severe than those already analyzed in the PVNGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15. The condition did not cause a violation of safety limits or the specified acceptable fuel design limits. The condition did not result in any challenges to the RCS pressure boundary or other fission product barriers. The safety limits for departure from nucleate boiling ratio and fuel peak centerline temperature were not exceeded as a result of this event. </P><P>This event would not have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function to safely shutdown </P><P>the reactor and did not result in a safety system functional failure as described by 10 CFR </P><P>50.73(a)(2)(v). </P><P>6. CAUSE OF THE EVENT: </P><P>The root cause evaluation for this event is in progress. An LER supplement will be submitted after completion of the evaluation. </P><P>Troubleshooting of CEA 57 identified that the ACTM stopped CEA motion but could not identify the specific condition which triggered actuation of the ACTM. </P><P>NRC F&quot;ORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY </P><Part><H5>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </H5><P>COMMISSION </P></Part><Part><H5>(10-2010) CONTINUATION SHEET </H5><P>2.
