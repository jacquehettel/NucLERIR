During the Component Design Basis Review (CDBR), it was determined that the closing force would be inadequate to fully close the MSIBVs upon the receipt of a Main Steam Isolation Signal when Steam Generator (SG) pressure is greater than 700 psi. This condition renders the MSIBVs inoperable when SG pressure is above 700 psi. At the time of discovery, Unit 1 was in Mode 5 and the MSIBVs were not required to be operable; Unit 2 and Unit 3 were in Mode 1, and the MSIBVs were required to be operable. Both Unit 2 and Unit 3 entered the applicable Technical Specification (TS) Limited Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves. As an immediate corrective action, Unit 2 and Unit 3 ensured the MSIBVs were closed, with their penetration flowpath isolated to comply with the conditions of TS LCO 3.6.3. Administrative barriers that existed at the time of the calculation revision (December 2000) were unsuccessful in preventing the error due to ineffective reviews and the lack of a questioning attitude. Calculations with the potential for this error were reviewed and evaluated. The extent of condition evaluation determined the error was limited to safetyrelated Air Operated Valve (AOV) gate valves. No similar events involving a non-conservative calculation for an AOV have been reported by PVNGS in the last three years. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) All times are Mountain Standard Time and approximate unless otherwise indicated. 1. REPORTING REQUIREMENT(S): This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.3, which requires containment isolation valves to be operable. 2. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S) AND COMPONENT(S): Each of Palo Verde's units contains two Steam Generators (SG) (EllS: SB / SG) which provide high pressure saturated steam to the main turbines through two 28 inch main steam lines (total of four per unit). Each of the main steam lines is isolated by a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) (EllS: SB / ISV): SG-UV170 and SG-UV180 for SG 1; and SG-UV171 and SG-UV181 for SG 2. The MSIVs close upon the receipt of a Main Steam Isolation Signal (MSIS). A common header connects each of the four main steam lines downstream of the MSIVs. One main steam line from each SG contains a normally closed MSIV Bypass Valve (MSIBV) (EllS: SB / ISV). The MSIBV SG-UV169 bypasses MSIV SG-UV180 from SG 1 and MSIBV SG-UV183 bypasses MSIV SG-UV171 from SG 2. The valve and actuator are Flowserve / Anchor Darling Models 93-15199 and W30748 respectively. The MSIBVs are 4 inch air operated flexible wedge gate valves. Air pressure opens the MSIBVs and spring force closes the MSIBVs when the air pressure is vented from the actuators. The MSIBVs close on an MSIS and fail closed on a loss of air pressure or control signal. The MSIBVs may be opened to warm-up downstream piping and equalize pressure across the MSIVs to permit opening of the MSIVs during plant startup. The MSIBVs are stroked open and closed for surveillance testing requirements. The safety function of the MSIBV is to close upon receipt of an MSIS. The MSIS actuates to close the MSIVs and MSIBVs upon receipt of low steam generator pressure, high steam generator water level, and high containment pressure. 3. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: On May 7,2010, Unit 1 was in Mode 5 (Cold Shutdown) following refueling, and Unit 2 and Unit 3 were at approximately 100 percent power in Mode 1 (Power Operations).

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) no major structures, systems, or components that were inoperable that contributed to this event. 4. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On May 7, 2010, during a review of a calculation for piston style Air Operated Valve (AOV) thrust and actuator sizing, Palo Verde identified a deficiency in the calculation. The calculation could not demonstrate the available closing force would fully close the MSIBVs (SG-UV169 and SG-UV183) when the SG pressure is above 700 psi. Further evaluation revealed the calculation error applies to all three units, and undersized valve actuators were installed during original plant construction. Operations personnel declared the MSIBVs inoperable in all three units. Unit 2 and Unit 3 entered LCO 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves, and ensured the MSIBVs were closed with their penetration flowpath isolated to comply with the conditions of TS LCO 3.6.3. Unit 1 was in Mode 5 and the MSIBVs were not required to be operable. 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES: The MSIBVs are not required to obtain safe shutdown, and are normally closed valves. An initial evaluation was performed based on both MSIBVs open at the same time. The evaluation determined this condition was bounded by the existing Main Steam Line Break with an MSIV open. Therefore, the calculation error did not result in a condition more severe than those previously analyzed in the PVNGS UFSAR, Chapter 15, Accident Analysis. The Engineering evaluation demonstrated the most limiting scenario was a Post Trip Steam Line Break (SLB) and a Mode 3 SLB with the failure of both of the MSIBVs to close. The results satisfied all acceptance criteria: • Minimum Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (mDNBR) remains above the Specified Acceptable Fuel Design Limit (SAFDL); • Linear Heat Rate (LHR) is below the 21 kW/ft limit, demonstrating that fuel centerline melting does not occur; • Reactor Coolant System (RCS) and Main Steam (MS) boundaries are not challenged by the increase in pressure or by the rate of change of pressure and temperature. The condition would not have prevented the fulfillment of any safety function and did not result in a safety system functional failure as defined by 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9·2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) There was no actual impact to the health and safety of the public as a result of the inability of the MSIBVs to close with SG pressures above 700 psi. The condition did not result in any . challenges to the fission product barriers or result in the release of radioactive materials. The 10 CFR 100 offsite dose criteria were never challenged or exceeded. 6. CAUSE OF THE EVENT: The investigation found that administrative barriers were unsuccessful in preventing the calculation error due to ineffective reviews and the lack of a questioning attitude .. Additionally, management of the AOV program did not consistently maintain adequate focus on engineering fundamentals in that the design basis limits were not clearly established and insufficient technical rigor introduced non-conservatisms into the valve design calculations. 7. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: The immediate corrective actions for Unit 2 and Unit 3 were to ensure the MSIBVs were closed with their penetration flowpath isolated to comply with the conditions of TS LCO 3.6.3. Following Unit 1 's refueling outage, the MSIBVs were closed and isolated to comply with TS LCO 3.6.3 prior to the SG pressure reaching 700 psi. Additionally, calculations with potential for this error were reviewed and evaluated. It was determined this type of error impacts Downcomer Feedwater Isolation and Steam Generator Blowdown Isolation valves. The following corrective actions have been completed: • Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL) actions that strengthened barriers to prevent errors in the area of the engineering fundamentals. Specifically, enhancements to the following two areas were developed and implemented to address this issue: o Engineering Training • Design and develop training on the use of Engineering Department Guide EDG-01, &quot;Engineering Human Performance Tools&quot;, and EDG-02, &quot;Engineering Human Performance Tools for Technical Task Risk / Rigor&quot;. • Develop an indoctrination course that introduces the documents that are core to understanding engineering standards, product quality and accountability. • Develop and implement Engineering excellence seminars to promote and instill engineering professionalism in three 2010 department improvement i areas; Alignment, Proactive Focus, and Engineering Advocacy. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9·2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
