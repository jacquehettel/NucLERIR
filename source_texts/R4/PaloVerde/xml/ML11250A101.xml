REPORTING REQUIREMENT(S): This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(8) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS). Trains A and 8 of the Qualified Safety Parameter Display System (QSPDS)(EIIS: IP) were inoperable for an amount of time greater than that allowed by TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.10, Post Accident Monitoring (PAM) Instrumentation. 2. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S) AND COMPONENT(S): The QSPDS analyzes and processes selected plant parameters and displays them to assist the operator (utility -licensed) in quickly assessing plant conditions during accident situations. Signals obtained from seismically qualified instrumentation are analyzed by class 1 E microprocessors. The output of these microprocessors is transmitted to the Control Room for continuous display and recording. These outputs are also transmitted to the nonclass Emergency Response Facility Data Acquisition and Display System (ERFDADS)(EIIS: IP). The QSPDS consists of two redundant class 1 E channels which are seismically qualified and electrically and physically independent for the display of safety parameters including inadequate core cooling (ICC) processing information. Indications provided include: • Core exit temperature -signal processing and display • Reactor Coolant System saturation (or subcooled) margin -computation and display • Reactor vessel water level -signal processing and display The ICC detection parameters provide the operator with continuous indication of the thermal-hydraulic state within the reactor vessel during the progression of an event leading to and from ICC. The QSPDS transmits data to the Control Room display units via fiber optic communication modems which are installed in control board 804. The fiber optic communication modems receive 120 VAC power independent of other QSPDS component power supplies. The QSPDS includes other independent data transmission interfaces to display equipment on control board 802 and ERFDADS.

INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: On June 29,2011, Palo Verde Unit 1 was in Operating MODE 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power at normal operating temperature and normal operating pressure. There were no other major structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. 4. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On June 29, 2011, in preparation for a modification to upgrade QSPDS, a walk down of the installed system in Unit 1 was performed. During the walk down, it was discovered that the 120 volt class power supply cables to the A and B train QSPDS display modems in control board B04 did not meet the minimum six inch physical separation criteria per Regulatory Guide 1.75 and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) Installation Specification for Cable Splicing and Terminations 13-EN-0306. On July 1, 2011, at 15:30, following further evaluation by Engineering and Operations, both trains of QSPDS were declared INOPERABLE. Conditions A and C ofTS LCO 3.3.10, Post Accident Monitoring (PAM) Instrumentation, were entered. On July 3,2011, at 16:05, both trains were declared OPERABLE and Conditions A and C of TS LCO 3.3.10 were exited after the power supply cables to the A and B train QSPDS display modems were rerouted per work order instructions to meet the physical separation criteria. 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES: The inadequate separation between the power supply cables to the A and B train QSPDS display modems could potentially cause a loss of power, due to a single fault, to both of the display modems that feed the QSPDS displays located on the Unit 1 control board 804. In the event that the QSPDS displays become unavailable, the train A Post Accident Monitoring recorders on control board B02, fed directly from the A QSPDS instrument chassis, would still remain available to the operators. Additionally, the communication link between both trains of QSPDS and ERFDADS would remain available to permit full functionality of data retrieval via ERFDADS for the operators and the Emergency Response Organization.

There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. This event did not prevent the fulfillment of a safety function and did not result in a safety system functional failure as described by 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(v). 6. CAUSE OF THE EVENT: The 120 volt class power supply cables to the A and B train QSPDS display modems were installed with less than six inches of physical separation, which did not meet Regulatory Guide 1.75 Revision 1, 1975, and PVNGS Installation Specification for Cable Splicing and Terminations 13-EN-0306 separation criteria. The event investigation is in progress and the results will be reported in a supplement to this LER. 7. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: As an immediate corrective action, the power supply cables to the A and B train QSPDS display modems were rerouted per work order instructions to meet the physical separation criteria and both trains of QSPDS were declared OPERABLE. In addition, the work order package for the QSPDS upgrade modification has been revised to contain Regulatory Guide 1.75 and PVNGS Installation Specification for Cable Splicing and Terminations 13-EN-0306 requirements in the work instructions. The event investigation is in progress and the results will be reported in a supplement to this LER. 8. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS: PVNGS has not reported a similar event in the past three years. NRr.
