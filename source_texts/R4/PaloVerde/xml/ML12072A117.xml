This incorrect configuration was the result of procedure changes made in 1986. Each train of the CREFS system contains two OSA dampers in series, with each damper actuated from one of the two separate channels of the control room essential filtration actuation signal (CREFAS). Upon identification, Unit 1 and Unit 3 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.9, condition A when both channels of CREFAS were determined to be inoperable. In response, both units placed an OPERABLE train of CREFS into operation per required action A.1. Unit 2 was defueled and irradiated fuel assemblies were not being moved; therefore, TS 3.3.9 was not applicable to Unit 2 at the time this condition was identified. In the three years prior to this event, a similar legacy issue was reported in which station procedures directed system configurations not permitted by the plant design (LER 0500528/529/530/2009-001-00, Safety Injection System Recirculation Alignment Results in Unanalyzed Condition). </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
