                    <abstract> On April 13, 2011, control room essential filtration system (CREFS)
                                        outside air intake (OSA) dampers were found to be in the
                                        normally closed position instead of the normally open
                                        position stipulated in the updated final safety analysis
                                        report. This incorrect configuration was the result of
                                        procedure changes made in 1986. Each train of the CREFS
                                        system contains two OSA dampers in series, with each damper
                                        actuated from one of the two separate channels of the
                                        control room essential filtration actuation signal (CREFAS).
                                        Upon identification, Unit 1 and Unit 3 entered Technical
                                        Specification (TS) 3.3.9, condition A when both channels of
                                        CREFAS were determined to be inoperable. In response, both
                                        units placed an OPERABLE train of CREFS into operation per
                                        required action A.1. Unit 2 was defueled and irradiated fuel
                                        assemblies were not being moved; therefore, TS 3.3.9 was not
                                        applicable to Unit 2 at the time this condition was
                                        identified. In the three years prior to this event, a
                                        similar legacy issue was reported in which station
                                        procedures directed system configurations not permitted by
                                        the plant design (LER 0500528/529/530/2009-001-00, Safety
                                        Injection System Recirculation Alignment Results in
                                        Unanalyzed Condition). </abstract>
