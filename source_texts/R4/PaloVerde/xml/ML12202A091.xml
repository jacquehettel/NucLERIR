On January 22,2012, during surveillance testing in unit 2, a control relay did not change state as expected and the essential ventilation dampers controlled by this relay did not change position. Operations declared the affected essential air handling units inoperable. The TSs do not contain specific Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) requirements for the affected essential ventilation equipment and no TS LCO Conditions were entered. Operations followed existing procedural guidance for inoperable ventilation equipment. The procedural guidance required operations to verify that there was no loss of safety function and that normal room cooling was available. The cause of the event was an inadequate procedure that was based on an incorrect understanding of the relationship between essential ventilation equipment that provides a support function to electrical distribution equipment and operability of the electrical distribution equipment. As corrective action, the affected procedure was revised. Similar reportable events have not occurred in the past three years. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET u.S.

REPORTING REQUIREMENT(S): </P><P>This LER is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(8) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) 3.8.4, 3.8.9, and 3.0.3 when inoperable essential ventilation system equipment rendered the supported electrical distribution equipment inoperable for a period greater than the TS Required Action Completion Time. </P><P>The condition which resulted in the inoperable essential ventilation equipment occurred </P><P>on January 22,2012, and was not initially determined to be reportable as a condition </P><P>prohibited by TS because administrative controls for inoperable essential ventilation </P><P>equipment were considered adequate and no specific TS requirements exist for the </P><P>support equipment. On May 9, 2012, the event was discussed on a teleconference with </P><P>the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Following the teleconference, a review of </P><P>the procedural guidance for inoperable essential ventilation equipment concluded that a </P><P>condition prohibited by TS had occurred when the TS requirements for the supported </P><P>electrical distribution equipment were not met. The condition is applicable to Units 1, 2, </P><P>and 3 because the procedural guidance has been used in each unit to manage </P><P>inoperable essential ventilation equipment. </P><P>2. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S) AND COMPONENT(S): </P><P>The safety related electrical power distribution systems are divided into two trains that </P><P>provide sufficient electrical power to ensure the availability of engineered safety feature </P><P>(ESF) systems so that the fuel, reactor coolant system, and containment design limits are </P><P>not exceeded. Each train of electrical equipment includes electrical switchgear, load </P><P>centers, motor control centers, distribution panels, auxiliary relay cabinets, inverters, </P><P>battery chargers and batteries. These components are located in their respective train </P><P>related rooms in the control building (EllS: NA). Additionally, safety related electrical </P><P>motor control centers and auxiliary relay cabinets are located in train related electrical </P><P>penetration rooms (EllS: NF) in the auxiliary building (EllS: NF). In both the control and </P><P>auxiliary buildings, the rooms containing safety related electrical distribution equipment </P><P>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY </P><Sect><H5>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) </H5><P>COMMISSION </P><P>(10-2010) </P></Sect><Sect><H5>CONTINUATION SHEET </H5><P>1.

The WC and normal HVAC systems are non-safety grade systems. The </P><P>essential chilled water system (EC) (EllS: KM) together with the essential ventilation </P><P>systems provide space cooling during design basis accidents (DBA) or transient </P><P>conditions. The EC system transfers heat from the safety related essential ventilation </P><P>systems to the ultimate heat sink through the essential cooling water (EllS: BI) and spray </P><P>pond systems (EllS: BS). The EC system and the related air handling units (AHU) and </P><P>air cooling units (ACU) are actuated by a safety injection actuation signal (EllS: JE) or </P><P>loss of power signal (EllS: JE), to provide cooling to the supported electrical distribution </P><P>equipment. </P><P>The control building essential ventilation equipment includes the fans, cooling coils, </P><P>dampers, ductwork, and controls that provide space cooling to the safety related electrical </P><P>switchgear and equipment rooms.

EVENT DESCRIPTION: </P><P>On May 9,2012, during an event investigation, a review of the procedural guidance for inoperable essential ventilation equipment by the investigation team concluded that a condition prohibited by TS had occurred in Unit 2 on January 22,2012, when the TS requirements for train &quot;B&quot; electrical distribution equipment were not met. </P><P>On January 22,2012, at 03:19, while conducting engineered safety feature actuation system (EllS: JE) train &quot;B&quot; subgroup relay testing in Unit 2, a ventilation damper control relay (EllS: DMP, RL Y) did not change state as expected and the essential ventilation dampers (EllS: DMP) controlled by this relay did not change position. Operations declared the ESF switchgear room essential AHUs and ESF equipment room essential AHUs (HJB-Z03 and HJB-Z04) inoperable because the affected dampers would not automatically align ventilation flow through the AHUs during DBA and transient conditions. The TSs do not contain specific Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) requirements, Conditions, or Required Actions for the affected essential ventilation equipment and no TS LCO Actions were entered. Operations followed existing procedural guidance for inoperable ventilation equipment contained in procedure 40ST9EC03, &quot;Essential Chilled Water and Ventilation Systems Inoperable Action Surveillance.&quot; As required by the procedural guidance, operations verified that the train &quot;A&quot; ESF switchgear room essential AHUs, ESF equipment room essential AHUs, and electrical distribution equipment remained OPERABLE and capable of performing their safety functions throughout the event.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES: </P><P>This condition did not adversely affect plant safety or the health and safety of the public. </P><P>There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event and the condition did not result in any challenges to the fission product barriers or result in any releases of radioactive materials. </P><P>When HJB-Z03 and HJB-Z04 were declared inoperable in Unit 2 on January 22,2012, operations personnel followed the procedural guidance in procedure 40ST-9EC03. Operations verified that there was no loss of safety function and that normal room cooling was available. The procedural guidance also limited the allowable out of service time for inoperable AHUs to less than 72 hours. The train &quot;A&quot; ESF switchgear room essential AHUs, ESF equipment room essential AHUs, and electrical distribution equipment remained OPERABLE and capable of performing their safety functions throughout the event. </P><P>The risk of a DBA was very low during the period that the safety related electrical </P><P>distribution equipment was inoperable. The out of service time for HJB-Z03 and HJB-Z04 </P><P>was limited to 72 hours, similar to the TS LCO time limit for the EC system. The </P><P>procedural guidance also required that initial and periodic cross train checks be </P><P>performed to verify operability of redundant train ESF systems to ensure that no loss of </P><P>safety function existed. </P><P>This event would not have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function to safely </P><P>shutdown the reactor and did not result in a safety system functional failure as described </P><P>by 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). </P><L><LI><LI_Label>6. </LI_Label><LI_Title>CAUSE OF THE EVENT: </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>7. </LI_Label><LI_Title>CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: </LI_Title></LI></L><P>The cause of the event was an inadequate procedure (40ST-9EC03) that was based on an incorrect understanding of the relationship between essential ventilation equipment The procedure 40ST -9EC03 was revised on May 11, 2012, to remove the inadequate procedural guidance and incorporate a fundamental change in addressing inoperable essential ventilation equipment that do not have TS requirements that support safety related electrical distribution equipment. Immediate operability determinations are now required for TS related electrical distribution equipment supported by inoperable essential ventilation equipment or the supported system must be declared inoperable. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A COMMISSION (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U_S.

The inadequate procedure guidance was established in 1991 and was based on a TS interpretation (developed in March 1991 but since cancelled) which incorrectly concluded that the effects of an inoperable essential AHU would not render the supported electrical distribution equipment inoperable, provided adequate compensatory actions were taken. The 1991 TS interpretation used action requirements from the original (i.e., prior to improved TS) TS 3.7.6, &quot;Essential Chilled Water System.&quot; The current improved TS for the EC system (3.7.10) does not include the same guidance as the original TS 3.7.6. The ventilation damper control relay failure discussed in the Event Description of this Licensee Event Report is not considered to be the cause of this event. The failed relay was an element in the event that initiated the questions which subsequently led to the conclusion that an inadequate procedure resulted in a condition prohibited by TS. Specifically, the procedure permitted placing the plant in a condition that did not conform to the single failure criterion without formally entering the TS LCO Actions for the affected equipment. Because the procedural guidance was contained in a common unit procedure, the condition is applicable to Units 1, 2, and 3. A review of the unit logs over the past three years confirmed that the procedure was used in units 1, 2, and 3. Use of the procedural guidance in procedure 40ST-9EC03 resulted in multiple past violations of TS LCO 3.8.4, 3.8.9, and, 3.0.3 in units 1, 2, and 3. </TH></TR></Table><P>The investigation of this event is still open.
