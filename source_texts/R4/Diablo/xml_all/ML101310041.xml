On March 9, 2010, at 23:39 (EST), PG&amp;E reported this unanalyzed condition to the NRC in accordance with 50. 72(b )(3)(ii)(8) (reference EN45754). The postulated sustained degraded voltage condition could have resulted in normally operating safetyrelated pump motors tripping overcurrent relays. As a result, these pumps would not be immediately available to mitigate a postulated accident. Previously, PG&amp;E had not considered this postulated worst case degraded voltage condition credible, and had therefore not analyzed for it. As a result, technical specification surveillance requirement (SR) 3.3.5.3 values are nonconservative. The immediate compensatory measure was to raise the first level undervoltage relay setpoints on the vital buses of both units, thus transferring loads to diesels prior to tripping operating motors on overcurrent. PG&amp;E continues to assess this condition, and will submit a supplemental LER following completion of the cause analysis and identification of corrective actions. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 1 </TH><TD>o 151 0 I0 I0 I2 171 5 </TD><TD>2010 </TD><TD>-I 0 I 0 I 2 I </TD><TD>01 0 </TD><TD><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure></TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT I. Plant Conditions At the time of discovery, both units were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal grid voltage. II. Description of Problem A. Background Each Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) unit has three 4 kV vital buses [EA]. The 4 kV vital buses are normally powered from auxiliary power transformers from the main generator. Normally operating safety-related loads powered by the 4 kV vital buses include two component cooling water (CCW)[BI] pumps and one auxiliary saltwater (ASW)[BS] pump. To protect the safety-related loads, the 4 kV vital buses are provided with loss of voltage and undervoltage [27] protection that transfers loads to the immediately available offsite power standby source (startup) and starts emergency onsite diesel generators (EDG)[EK] during a loss of voltage or degraded voltage condition. The EDGs provide emergency power to mitigate an accident and safely shutdown the unit when offsite power is unavailable. The loss of voltage relays protect each 4 kV vital bus while connected to an offsite power source. These relays have inverse time characteristics that actuate more quickly in response to more severe undervoltage conditions, with only a slight delay upon complete voltage failure. These relays are referred to as the first level undervoltage relays (FLURs). The second level undervoltage relays (SLURs) provide undervoltage protection for degraded bus voltage conditions. The SLURs actuate at greater than or equal to 3785 volts. Both of the SLURs on a bus must actuate to initiate EDG start and load shed timers for the associated bus. If voltage remains below the reset voltage for 10 seconds, the associated EDG will receive a start signal. If voltage remains below the reset voltage for 20 seconds, loads are shed from the bus in preparation for load sequencing onto the EDG. If voltage recovers prior to these time limits, the SLURs reset. The reset voltage is set to avoid unnecessary EDG starts and load shedding of a vital bus. The FLURs and SLURs are designed to protect safety-related loads from damage on loss or degradation of 4 kV vital bus voltage. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.5 &quot;Loss of Power (LOP) Diesel Generator (DG) Start Instrumentation&quot; Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.3.5.3 specifies the FLUR and SLUR setpoints and time delays. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 1 </TH><TD/><TD/><TD/><TD>01 0 </TD><TD><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure></TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) M-75 &quot;4 kV Vital Bus Undervoltage Relay Calibration&quot; ensures the relays meet the values specified in TS SR 3.3.5.3. B. Event Description On March 9, 2010, PG&amp;E analyzed the consequences of accidents concurrent with postulated degraded grid voltage for a non-conforming condition, second level undervoltage time delay relay not reflected in accident analyses. As a result, PG&amp;E discovered both units were in an unanalyzed condition. The postulated sustained degraded grid voltage condition was that the 4kV voltage remained below the SLUR setpoint and slightly above the FLUR setpoint, resulting in the vital buses experiencing the degraded voltage condition until the SLUR time delays were completed. This condition could have resulted in normally operating safety-related pump motors tripping their overcurrent relays [51]. As a result, these pumps may not have been immediately available to mitigate a postulated accident as credited in accident analyses. On March 9, 2010, at 20:39 (PST), PG&amp;E reported this as an unanalyzed condition (8-hour report) to the NRC in accordance with 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) (reference EN45754). PG&amp;E implemented interim compensatory measures via Shift Orders to prevent auto transfer to startup of one vital 4 kV bus per unit. As a result, offsite startup power was considered inoperable in both Units 1 and 2. On March 9, 2010, at 21 :58 (PST for Unit 1, 21 :57 for Unit 2), in response to the above interim compensatory measures, operators declared startup power inoperable and entered 72-hour TS 3.8.1 Action A.2 for one inoperable offsite power source. In order to exit the TS Action, PG&amp;E implemented a temporary modification (compensatory measure) that raised the first level undervoltage relay setpoints on the vital buses of both Units 1 and 2, (from approximately 70 percent to approximately 80 percent) thus allowing transfer of loads to EDGs prior to tripping on overcurrent. On March 12,2010, at 13:17 (PST for Unit 1,13:18 for Unit 2), following adjustment of FLUR setpoints, completion of STP M-75, and elimination of the previously established compensatory measures, operators exited the 72-hour TS action.

Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected No additional safety systems were adversely affected by this event. E. Method of Discovery During the Component Design Basis Inspection, NRC inspectors asked PG&amp;E to evaluate various postulated sustained degraded 4kV voltage scenarios. As a result of the evaluation, this issue was identified. F. Operator Actions Interim compensatory measures were implemented to protect normally operating safety-related pumps from postulated degraded voltage. Operators declared Startup power inoperable and complied with 72-hour TS 3.8.1 Action A.2 until the FLUR setpoints could be raised on the vital buses to higher values. G. Safety System Responses None III. Cause of the Problem A. Immediate Cause The immediate cause of the unanalyzed condition was that PG&amp;E had not considered this postulated worst case degraded voltage condition credible, and had therefore not analyzed for it. As a result, technical specification (TS) surveillance requirement (SR) 3.3.5.3 values are non conservative. B. Cause A cause analysis has not been completed.

Assessment of Safety Consequences The postulated degraded voltage of approximately 70 percent for over ten seconds could cause normally operating safety-related motors (two CCW pump motors and one ASW pump motor) to trip on overcurrent. The condition was considered reportable because accident analyses assumed normally running safety-related loads would automatically transfer to an EDG. Therefore this event is considered unanalyzed. The assessment of safety consequences will be included in the supplemental LER. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions PG&amp;E implemented compensatory measures by raising the FLUR setpoints on the vital buses of both units, thus protecting operating safety-related motors from tripping on overcurrent during postulated sustained degraded voltage conditions.
