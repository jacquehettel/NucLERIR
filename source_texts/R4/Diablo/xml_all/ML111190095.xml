DCPP operators implemented the requirements of Casualty Procedure M-5, &quot;Response to Tsunami Warning.&quot; During this event, on March 11,2011, at 0742 PST, plant personnel were evacuated from the DCPP Intake Structure to protect their health and safety. Evacuation of security personnel from the Intake Structure constitutes a deviation from DCPP License Condition 2.E, Physical Protection, which was authorized pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54(x). On March 11,2011, at 1055 PST, plant security personnel were redeployed to the Intake Structure, restoring compliance with DCPP License Condition 2.E, Physical Protection. No damage or injuries were observed as a result of this tsunami event and there was no impact on the health and safety of the general public.

Plant Conditions At the time of the event, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Description of Problem A. Background The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issues tsunami advisories and warnings based on natural events that have the potential to produce a tsunami. To prepare for and mitigate the impact of a tsunami event, DCPP Casualty Procedure CP M-5, &quot;Response to Tsunami Warning,&quot; provides detailed actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning. B. Event Description On March 10,2011, at 2146 PST, a 9.0 earthquake event took place off the northern coast of Japan. This event produced a tsunami that was felt throughout the Pacific Basin and countries along the Pacific Rim. At 0123 PST on March 11,2011, a tsunami warning was issued by NOAA. An emergency was declared at the Unusual Event classification at 0123 PST and DCPP entered CP M-5. Plant personnel were evacuated from the DCPP Intake Structure at 0742 PST in preparation for the arrival of the first of several tsunami waves estimated to arrive at 0808 PST. Evacuation of security personnel from the intake structure constituted a deviation from DCPP License Condition 2.E, Physical Protection. This deviation was authorized pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54(x). Plant security personnel were redeployed to the Intake Structure at 1055 PST after passage of the largest anticipated tsunami waves, and personnel safety from this event was no longer a concern. C. Status of Inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components that Contributed to the Event None D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Effected None E. Method of Discovery Notification of a tsunami warning from NOAA's National Weather Service, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center F. Operator Actions DCPP operators implemented the requirements of CP M-5, which included temporary evacuation of plant personnel from the Intake Structure. G.

Cause of the Problem A. Immediate Cause On March 10,2011, at 2146 PST, a 9.0 earthquake event took place off the northern coast of Japan. This event produced a tsunami that was felt throughout the Pacific Basin and countries along the Pacific Rim. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The temporary relocation of plant personnel from the Intake Structure was made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54(x) and constituted a deviation of License Condition 2.E, Physical Protection. Security personnel maintained the Intake Structure under continuous surveillance, visually and remotely, during the evacuation period. A search of the Intake Structure was conducted upon redeployment of security guards. There was no impact to the health and safety of the general public as a result of the deviation from the license condition. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions In preparation for the arrival of the first of several tsunami waves, estimated to be 0808 PST, plant personnel were evacuated from the DCPP Intake Structure at 0742 PST. At 1055 PST, DCPP redeployed plant personnel and reposted security guards once the tsunami wave danger had passed. B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence (CAPR) No corrective actions to prevent recurrence are warranted for a tsunami. VI. Additional Information A. Failed Components None B. Previous Similar Events There have been no previous instances at DCPP where 10 CFR 50.54(x) was applied due to occurence of a natural hazard. C. Industry Reports None </TH></TR></Table></TaggedPDF-doc>
