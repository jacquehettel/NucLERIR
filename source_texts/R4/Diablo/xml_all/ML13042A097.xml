PG&amp;E identified these concerns in the course ofresponding to requests for information and questions from NRC inspectors conducting a Diablo Canyon Power Plant Triennial Fire Protection Inspection. On October 9,2012, at 21:32 PDT, PG&amp;E reported these concerns to the NRC in Event Notification Number 48395. PG&amp;E established compensatory actions in accordance with the DCPP Fire Protection Program requirements and plant procedures on discovery of each condition. PG&amp;E reviewed the NFP A 805 project open items to ensure they complied with Appendix R or were addressed in the corrective action program with compensatory measures established as necessary. Additionally, PG&amp;E reviewed all alternate compensatory measures (ACMs) implemented by the fire protection program to ensure that all credited ACMs were adequate to ensure safe shutdown (SSD). An extent of condition review identified no additional conditions affecting SSD analysis. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

II. Problem Description A. Background The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Fire Protection Program maintains the design, procedures and equipment necessary for fire prevention, detection, suppression, and separation ofredundant safe shutdown (SSD) equipment and cabling [CBL]. Through implementation of the DCPP Fire Protection Program, DCPP is assured of being able to achieve and maintain SSD of the plant in the event of a fire. DCPP's licensing basis includes the following requirements of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Sections IILG, &quot;Fire Protection of Safe Shutdown Capability,&quot; and IILL, &quot;Alternative and Dedicated Shutdown Capability:&quot; • Fire protection of SSD capability, including equipment, component, and cable separation, to ensure that the minimum equipment necessary to obtain SSD is available, despite the effects of a postulated fire. • Alternative or dedicated means to support SSD when the potential exists for fire damage to redundant SSD components with, or without, loss of offsite power. In the early 1990's, in response to plant modifications and identified design concerns, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) established manual actions to mitigate a fire associated with the control circuits of the reactor coolant pump seal control valve. On July 19,2001, PG&amp;E implemented Plant Administrative Work Procedure A WP E-002, &quot;10 CFR 50, Appendix R Safe Shutdown Analysis.&quot; This procedure provides guidance for performing 10 CFR 50 Appendix R, Post Fire Safe Shutdown Analysis including developing manual actions to mitigate a fire scenario. In 2005, PG&amp;E committed to adopt National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 805, &quot;Performance-Based Standard for Fire Protection for Light Water Reactor Electric Generating Plants,&quot; 2001 Edition, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.48(c) for DCPP Units 1 and 2, and submit the associated license amendment request by June 28, 2013. As part ofthe NFP A 805 transition, PG&amp;E performed additional circuit analysis for SSD circuits. PG&amp;E recognized that additional circuit analysis for the NFP A 805 transition could identify conditions that would not conform to 10 CFR 50, Appendix R. Early in the NFP A 805 transition, PG&amp;E identified NFPA 805 transition questions as &quot;open items.&quot; Some ofthese open items were regarding adequacy of the existing Appendix R program. Open items required further evaluation to determine ifthey adversely impacted the Appendix R program and whether or not compensatory measures (CM) were required. Open items that impacted the Appendix R program required CMs in accordance with DCPP Equipment Control Guideline (ECG) 18.7.1, &quot;10 CFR 50 Appendix R Fire Rated Assemblies.&quot; These CMs typically consisted of a fire watch until </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

PG&amp;E established multiple ACMs to address the identified Appendix R non-conforming conditions. </P><P>At the start ofDCPP's NFPA 805 transition in December 2005, fire protection regulatory guidance regarding circuit failure issues and multiple spurious operations (MSOs) was still being developed. As a result, PG&amp;E concluded that MSOs were not part ofthe current licensing basis for Appendix R SSD analysis, and that MSO issues would be tracked and addressed as a part ofthe NFPA 805 transition. MSOs identified during this transition period were reviewed by an expert panel and the credible scenarios were incorporated into the Appendix R SSD analysis and plant procedures. PG&amp;E implemented CMs, as recommended by the expert panel, until the MSOs could be resolved via the Risk Evaluation process in NFPA 805. </P><P>In October 2009, the NRC provided MSO guidance and CM implementation guidance in Regulatory Guide 1.189, &quot;Fire Protection for Nuclear Power Plants,&quot; Revision 2. The purpose of Regulatory Guide 1.189 was to provide clarifications and additional NRC guidance for fire protection programs. PG&amp;E did not evaluate the previously-identified MSOs against the new Regulatory Guide 1.189 guidance. </P><P>In 2010, NFPA 805 Project Procedure, EPM-DP-RSD-001 was revised (Revision 2) to establish a process for identifying and evaluating variances from deterministic requirements (VFDRs) as part ofthe fire risk evaluation process. This procedure established the standard for the NFPA 805 transition project that is still underway. </P><P>On March 29,2011, PG&amp;E implemented Plant Procedure XII.DC2, &quot;Regulatory Operating Experience,&quot; to provide requirements for proactively communicating, evaluating and acting on industry experience regarding certain NRC violations, proposed changes to regulations, inspection procedures, NRC standards and guidance documents that have a potential to apply to DCPP. This procedure was established as a best practice for DCPP based on lessons learned, but was not applied retroactively to previously published regulatory information. </P><P>B. Event Description </P><P>On October 8, 2012, during the review ofNFPA 805 variances from deterministic requirements (VFDRs), PG&amp;E identified fire areas that did not conform to 10 CFR 50, Appendix R requirements and did not have proceduralized or practiced CMs in place. PG&amp;E identified these concerns in the course ofresponding to requests for information and questions from NRC inspectors conducting a DCPP Triennial Fire Protection Inspection. The NRC had requested copies ofall the 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, non-compliances identified by NFPA 805 and the ACMs subsequently taken. One ofthe concerns PG&amp;E identified was the potential to lose both trains ofheating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) [VK] to the 480-volt switchgear and battery [BTRY]/inverter [INVT] rooms in the event ofa fire. PG&amp;E originally identified this concern on September 9, 2008; however, PG&amp;E did not implement CMs or make the necessary changes to the SSD analysis or procedures. PG&amp;E also identified the potential to lose all reactor coolant pump (RCP) [P] seal [SEAL] cooling in the event of a fire. PG&amp;E originally identified and evaluated this MSO concern and implemented a CM in 2008. However, the time-critical operator action did not properly account for the time it would take to traverse through the area in which the fire occurred. This was not addressed by the current SSD analysis or CM for the area. On October 9,2012, at 21:32 PDT, PG&amp;E reported these concerns to the NRC via Event Notification (EN) Number 48395. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

DCPP SSD analysis credits manual closure ofthe main steam isolation valves [ISV] to isolate steam supply to the main feedwater pumps. However, the time it would take to complete these manual actions could exceed the time to prevent SG overfill. PG&amp;E already had an established CM for this fire area. Accordingly, PG&amp;E documented this new fire concern as an additional item to be addressed by the compensatory measure. On October 31, 2012, at 21 :28 PDT, PG&amp;E provided an update to NRC EN Number 48395 identifying that several ACMs were not in plant procedure, CP M-1 0, &quot;Fire Protection of Safe Shutdown Equipment.&quot; PG&amp;E identified these concerns while reviewing implementation ofACMs due to questions from NRC inspectors conducting a DCPP Triennial Fire Protection Inspection. PG&amp;E has evaluated this further and concluded that ACMs had been adequately implemented in CP M-10. Therefore, on January 30, 2013, at 16:44 PDT, PG&amp;E retracted the October 31,2012, EN update. On November 1,2012, while responding to a 2012 NRC Fire Protection Triennial Inspection request for information, PG&amp;E identified that multiple hot shorts could result in the loss of control ofthe RCP seal charging flow control valve (FCV) [FCV] or fail the valve in the open position. The Appendix R SSD analysis credits anoperator action to open the valve's breaker [BKR] and control the valve from the hot shutdown panel [PL]. However, opening the breaker is not adequate because an additional hot short could prevent control ofthe valve. PG&amp;E already had a CM established for this fire area. Accordingly, PG&amp;E documented this new fire concern as an additional item to be addressed by the CM. PG&amp;E established CMs in accordance with the DCPP Fire Protection Program requirements and plant procedures upon discovery of each condition that did not have a CM established at time of discovery. C. Status ofInoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event None. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. E. Method of Discovery The concerns were discovered during the response to NRC requests for information and questions from the NRC inspectors conducting DCPP's 2012 Triennial Fire Protection Inspection. F. Operator Actions Operators established compensatory measures as required by the DCPP Fire Protection Program requirements. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Safety System Responses </P><P>None. </P><P>III. Cause ofthe Problem </P><P>PG&amp;E concluded that there was no formal process established to evaluate open items identified during the earlier </P><P>stages of DCPP's NFPA 805 transition. Also, PG&amp;E had no formal process to assess changes in NRC regulatory </P><P>guides for impact to DCPP. Therefore, reconciliation of past evaluations had not been performed using </P><P>current-day NRC guidance. </P><P>The most probable cause ofthe concern identified on November 1,2012, was a human error made in the 1990's by evaluators developing the Appendix R compliance strategy for the RCP seal charging FCV. </P><P>IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences </P><P>PG&amp;E's risk assessment for the applicable fire areas concluded that these concerns were not risk significant and did not adversely affect the health and safety ofthe public. </P><P>V. Corrective Actions </P><P>A. Immediate Corrective Actions </P><P>PG&amp;E established CMs in accordance with ECG 18.7.1 on the date each concern was identified. PG&amp;E established I-hour roving fire watches in the areas with the potential for a fire scenario to cause a condition where there are no current actions to mitigate the respective concerns in the SSD procedures. </P><P>PG&amp;E reviewed the NFPA 805 project open items to ensure they complied with Appendix R or were addressed in the corrective action program with CMs established as necessary. Additionally, PG&amp;E reviewed all alternate compensatory measures implemented by the fire protection program to ensure that all credited ACMs were adequate to ensure SSD. An extent ofcondition review identified no additional conditions affecting SSD analysis. </P><P>B. Other Corrective Actions </P><P>PG&amp;E developed the following corrective actions to address the concerns ofthis report: </P><P>1) PG&amp;E will revise Appendix R safe shutdown analysis calculations M-928, &quot;10 CFR 50 Appendix R Safe Shutdown Analysis,&quot; M-I088, &quot;10 CFR 50 Appendix R Post-Fire Operator Manual Action Feasibility,&quot; and implementing procedure CP M-I0 to incorporate the issue ofloss of HVAC and require the use ofportable fans to mitigate that loss. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
