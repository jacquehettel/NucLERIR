This resulted in the valid start of all three Unit 1 emergency diesel generators (EDGs). The EDGs successfully started, but did not load, because the associated buses remained energized by the 500 kV auxiliary offsite power source. On August 16,2013, at 02:36 EDT, DCPP made an 8-hour rep~rt to the NRC (NRC-Event Notification Number 49287). A failed bolted connection between a flex link and a stationary contact caused the SUT LTC diverter switch to fail. It was determined that the bolted connection failed because the vendor did not adequately torque the connection during assembly and installation. Corrective action include the revision of SUT LTC maintenance instructions to include bolted termination torque specifications. Additionally, DCPP will include replacement parts material checks in procurement or work planning documents for future LTC maintenance. This event did not adversely affect the health or safety ofthe public. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)u,s, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Plant Conditions Just prior to, and following, the event, Unit 1 operated in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor [RCT] power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Problem Description A. Background The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) electrical systems are designed to ensure an adequate supply of electrical power to all essential equipment during normal operation and under accident conditions. Nonvital4 kV alternating current (AC) auxiliary buses [EA] are energized by either offsite power [FK] or power from the main generator [GEN]. Vital AC buses [EB] have an additional available sburce, which includes onsite power [EK] delivered by emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [DG]. The electrical systems are designed so that failure of anyone electrical device will not prevent operation ofthe minimum required engineered safety feature (ESF) equipment. -DCPP offsite power is supplied by two offsite power circuits that are physically and electrically separated and independent of each other: (1) a 230 kV connection and (2) a 500 kV connection. The 230 kV offsite power circuit provides offsite startup and standby power, and provides an immediately available source of offsite power to the 4 kV system. To make power available to the vital 4 kV buses, the 230 kV offsite power circuit provides power to Startup Transformers (SUT)[XFMR] 1-1 and 2-1 (230 kV to 12 kV), which then feeds Startup Transformer (SUT) 1-2 and 2-2 (12 kV to 4 kV). The 500 kV offsite power circuit provides for transmission ofthe plant's power output, and is also available as a delayed access source of offsite power after the main generator is disconnected. To produce onsite power, each unit has three EDGs, which supply power to the 4 kV vital AC buses when power is unavailable or voltage degrades below a point at which required ESF loads would be operable. After the EDGs start they supply power to their respective vital bus ifthe buses are deenergized. Ifthe vital buses are not de energized, the EDGs continue to run in standby mode, ready to provide power if required. The EDGs also start in standby mode on low 12 kV startup bus voltage but do not load onto the buses. B. Event Description On August 15,2013, at 18:24 PDT, DCPP Unit 1 lost its 230 kV offsite power source when the SUT 1-1 load tap changer (LTC) diverter switch failed. This caused a valid anticipatory start of all Unit 1 EDGs, and is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The Unit 1 EDGs successfully started on loss of Unit 1 12kV Startup voltage, but did not load, because the associated buses [BU] remained energized by the 500 kV auxiliary offsite power source. However, the safety-related onsite EDGs would have provided power to mitigate the consequences of an accident if both sources of offsite power had been lost. On August 16, 20l3, at 02:36 EDT, DCPP made an 8-hour report to the NRC (NRC Event Notification Number 49287). </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Status ofInoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event The SUT 1-1 LTC diverter switch failure, and subsequent loss ofvoltage to the Unit 1 12 kV startup bus, initiated the valid start signal to the Unit 1 EDGs. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected All Unit 1 EDGs started and ran in standby. E. Method of Discovery Licensed plant operators immediately recognized the event by alarms and indications received in the control room. F. Operator Actions After ensuring that all vital buses remained energized, operators manually shut down the Unit 1 EDGs. G. Safety System Responses All Unit 1 EDGs staIied as designed with no problems observed. Ill. Cause of the Problem A. Immediate Cause DCPP Unit 1 lost its 230 kV offsite power source when the SUT 1-1 LTC diverter switch failed. B. Cause An apparent cause evahlation, supported by a vendor analysis, concluded that vendor error during bolt installation and torquing caused a loose, high-resistance bolted connection between a flex link and a stationary contact in ~he diverter tank. This high resistance caused the SUT LTC divelier switch to fail. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The 230 kV startup power is a standby system. With the successful start of all EDGs upon the loss of startup power, the vital AC power supply to all emergency core cooling system loads would have been maintained. Probabilistic risk analysis results in an incremental core damage and incremental large early release probabilities that were well below their respective acceptance criteria. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions The SUT LTC diverter was replaced. Post-maintenance testing confirmed that the transfom1er high voltage windings and bushings were not damaged by the electrical event experienced inside the LTC diverter switch compartment, and that SUT 1-1 was no longer degraded. B. Other Corrective Actions DCPP will revise SUT LTC maintenance instructions to include bolted termination torque specifications. This action will also add guidance on which critical steps will be performed by the vendor, add a requirement to record torque values, and add quality verification checks during bolt torquing. Additionally, DCPP will include replacement parts material checks in procurement or work planning documents for future LTC maintenance. VI. Additional Information A. Failed Components SUT 1-1 LTC diverter switch failed. B. Previous Similar Events On June 23, 2013, at 21:20 PDT, Pacific Gas and Electric lost its 230 kV offsite power source at DCPP when an offsite transmission system relay actuated. This resulted in the valid start of all Unit 1 and 2 EDGs, three per unit. All EDGs successfully started, but did not load since all associated buses remained energized by auxiliary power. All systems operated as designed with no problems observed. (NRC Event Notification Number 49143, and LER 1-2013-003-00). </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
