Plant Conditions </P><P>At the time ofthe event, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor [RCT] power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. </P><L><LI><LI_Label>II. </LI_Label><LI_Title>Problem Description </LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>A. </LI_Label><LI_Title>Background </LI_Title></LI></L><P>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Fire Protection Program maintains the design, procedures and equipment </P><P>necessary for fIre prevention, detection, suppression, and separation ofredundant safe shutdown (SSD) equipment </P><P>and cabling [CBL]. Through implementation ofthe Fire Protection Program, DCPP is assured ofbeing able to </P><P>achieve and maintain SSD ofthe plant in the event of a fIre. </P><P>DCPP's licensing basis includes the following requirements of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Sections III.G, &quot;Fire 
Protection of Safe Shutdown Capability,&quot; and III.L, &quot;Alternative and Dedicated Shutdown Capability:" 
</P><L><LI><LI_Label>• </LI_Label><LI_Title>Fire protection ofSSD capability, including equipment, component, and cable separation, to ensure that the 
minimum equipment necessary to obtain SSD is available, despite the effects of a postulated fIre. 
</LI_Title></LI><LI><LI_Label>• </LI_Label><LI_Title>Alternative or dedicated means to support SSD when the potential exists for fIre damage to redundant SSD 
components with, or without, loss of offsite power. 
</LI_Title></LI></L><P>PacifIc Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) committed to adopt National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) </P><P>Standard 805, &quot;Performance-Based Standard for Fire Protection for Light Water Reactor Electric Generating </P><P>Plants,&quot; 2001 Edition, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.48(c) for DCPP Units 1 and 2, and submit the associated </P><P>license amendment request by June 28,2013. At the start of DCPP's NFPA 805 transition in December 2005, fIre </P><P>protection regulatory standards regarding circuit failure issues and multiple spurious operations (MSOs) were still </P><P>being developed. As a result, PG&amp;E concluded that MSOs were not part ofthe current licensing basis for </P><P>Appendix R SSD analysis, and that MSO issues would be tracked and addressed as a part of the NFP A 805 </P><P>transition. MSOs identifIed during this transition period were reviewed by an expert panel and the credible </P><P>scenarios were incorporated into the SSD analysis and plant procedures. PG&amp;E implemented compensatory </P><P>measures, as recommended by the expert panel, until the MSOs can be resolved via the Risk Evaluation process in </P><P>NFPA 805. PG&amp;E continues to use this process for any newly identifIed MSOs. PG&amp;E is currently evaluating the </P><P>past implementation ofthis process further and will provide the conclusions in a supplemental report. </P><P>During this NFPA 805 transition period, PG&amp;E performed additional circuit analysis for SSD. PG&amp;E identifIed </P><P>variances from deterministic requirements (VFDRs). VFDRs are design aspects that potentially impact current </P><P>10 CFR 50, Appendix R compliance and SSD. The NFPA transition process now requires PG&amp;E to review each </P><P>VFDR and evaluate whether the VFDR resulted in nonconformance to the Appendix R design requirements. </P><P>PG&amp;E had not established this VFDR review process until 20 1 O. VFDRs determined to be nonconforming to </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Event Description On October 8, 2012, during the review ofNFPA 805 VFDRs, PG&amp;E identified fire areas that did not conform to 10 CFR 50, Appendix R requirements and did not have established, proceduralized, or practiced compensatory measures in place. PG&amp;E identified these concerns in the course ofresponding to requests for information and questions from NRC inspectors conducting a triennial fire protection inspection. One ofthe concerns PG&amp;E identified was the potential to lose both trains ofheating, ventilation and air conditioning [VK] to the 480-volt switchgear and battery [BTRY]/inverter [INVT] rooms in the event of a fire. PG&amp;E originally identified this concern on September 9,2008; however, PG&amp;E did not implement compensatory measures or make the necessary changes to the SSD analysis or procedures. PG&amp;E also identified the potential to lose all reactor coolant pump (RCP) [P] seal [SEAL] cooling in the event of a fire. PG&amp;E originally identified and evaluated this MSO concern and implemented a compensatory measure in 2008. However, the time-critical operator action did not properly account for the time it would take to traverse through the area in which the fire occurred. PG&amp;E identified the potential to lose the ability to trip the running RCPs in the event offire. This was not addressed by the current SSD analysis or compensatory measure for the area. On October 9,2012, at 16:30 PDT, PG&amp;E reported these concerns to the NRC via Event Notification (EN) Number 48395. On October 23,2012, the NRC Triennial Fire Protection Inspection team postulated a MSO scenario that could result in steam generator (SG) [SG] overfill. DCPP SSD analysis credits manual closure ofthe main steam isolation valves [ISV] to isolate steam supply to the main feedwater pumps. However, the time it would take to complete these manual actions could exceed the time to prevent SG overfill. Compensatory actions had already been established prior to identifying this concern. On October 31,2012, PG&amp;E provided an update to NRC EN Number 48395 identifying that several alternate compensatory measures were not in plant procedure, CP M-10, &quot;Fire Protection of Safe Shutdown Equipment.&quot; PG&amp;E is currently.evaluating this further and will provide the conclusions in a supplemental report. On November 1,2012, PG&amp;E identified a MSO that could result in the loss of control ofthe RCP seal charging flow control valve [FCV] or fail the valve in the open position. The Appendix R SSD analysis credits an operator action to open the valve's breaker [BKR] and control the valve from the hot shutdown panel [PL]. However, opening the breaker is not adequate as an additional hot short could prevent the control ofthe valve. Compensatory actions had already been established prior to identifying this concern. PG&amp;E established compensatory actions in accordance with the DCPP Fire Protection Program requirements and plant procedures upon discovery ofeach condition that did not already have one established. Also, PG&amp;E reviewed the extent ofthese conditions and identified no additional issues. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
