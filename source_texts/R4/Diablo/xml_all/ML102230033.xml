Based on this letter, PG&amp;E evaluated past operation of the 230 kV offsite powe'r system. On June 7, 2010, PG&amp;E determined that the .230 kV system was operated in a condition prohibited by TS and reportable under 10 CFR §50.73(a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), and (a)(2)(v). Specifically, the 230 kV system for Unit 1 and 2 was placed in an inoperable configuration 'between July 16,2007 at 0245 PDT until July 27,2007 at 1655 PDT, 'September 10,2007 at 0140 PDT until September 15,,2007 at 0440 PDT, and November 3, 2008 at 0224 PST until November 7,2008 at 0332 PST, in each event exceeding the 72 hour allowed outage time. Thisrepo'rt will besupplerilented for any additional event uncovered in the archived operating logs. ) The cause of operating in a condition prohibited by TS 3.8.1 is a non-conservative assumption leading to misint~rpretation of 230 kV licensing basis requirements in 1995, which produced incorrect operating procedures. Corrective a,ctio'ns for this event include revision to a station . , procedure and revision to licensing documents in accordance with ~he above.

II. , Plant Conditions At the time of the events in 2007, cited below, when the offsite power circuit was operated in a condition prohibited by TS, Unit 1 and Ulilit 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. I Description of Problem \ A. Background( Each unit has a dedicated 230kV [EA] to 12kV [EB] standby startup transformer [XFMR]. The electrical design of the bus work allows for the 12 kV System to be cross-tied between the units should a standby startup transformer be removed from service. In this configuration, one 230kV to 12kV standby startup transformer . ' would be providing standby power service for both units. Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.~ requires two offsite power circuits to be operable: 500 kV and 230 kV.' With one offsite ~ircuit inoperable, TS 3.8.1 Condition A requires verification of correct breaker alignment and power availability for each required offsite circuit within 1 hour and every 8 hours thereafter, and. restoration of the inoperable circuit within 72 hours. B. Event Description On December 14,2009 and July 7,2010, the U.S. NRC issued letters at the request of PG&amp;E that provided an interpretation of TS 3.8.1. Specifically it was clarified that the operability and availability of the 230 kV offsite power source depends on the capability of the offsite power circuits to support worst-case loading conditions and that TS 3.8.1 did not allow for across-tie configuration to maintain system operability. The worst-case loading was a change to prior DCPP understanding, such that the 230 kV system could be overloaded when placed in a cross-tie configuration. Based on the above NRC letters, an evaluation of past operability was conducted from 2005 to present. On June 07, 2010 after reviewing the operating history, it was determined that the 230 kV System was operated in a condition prohibited by TS on three occasions during the past three years .. , On July 16, 2007 at 0245 PDT, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) both units should have entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 action 'A' for maintenance on the Unit 2 Standby Startup Transformer (Le. unit cross-tie established). The Unit 2 Standby , Startup Transformer was returned to service and declared operable on July 27, 2007, 1655 PDT (i.e, unit cross~tie opened). </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (lER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FA~ILlTY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 2 </TH><TD>o 15t0t 0 I0 I2 171 5 </TD><TD>2010 </TD><TD>-I0 I0 I 3 I </TD><TD>01 0 </TD><TD>3 IOF I 5 </TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT On September 10, 2007 at 0140 PDT, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) both units should have entered TS 3.8.1 action 'A' for maintenance on the Unit 1 Standby Startup Transformer (i.e. unit cross-tie established). The Unit 1 Standby Startup Transformer was returned to service and declared operable on September 15,2007,0440 PDT (i.e. unit cross-tie opened). On November 3,2008 at 0224 PST, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) both units should have entered TS 3.8.1 action 'A' for maintenance on the Unit 2 Standby Startup Transformer (i.e.'unit cross-tie established). The Unit 2 Standby Startup Transformer was returned to service and declared operable on November 7,2008 at 0332 PST (i.e. unit cross-tie opened). C. Status of Inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components that Contributed to the Event None D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected No additional safety systems were adversely affected by this event. E. Method of Discovery PG&amp;E conducted a review from 2005 to present of the operability for the Startup offsite power circuit based on the U.S. NRC interpretation, dated December 14, 2009, of DCPP TS 3.8.1. This review concluded that entries into TS 3.8.1 exceeded the allowed outage time and thus constituted a condition that was prohibited by TS 3.8.1. F. Operator Actions None G.

Cause The cause of operating in a condition prohibited by TS 3.8.1 is a non-conservative assumption leading to misinterpretation of 230 kV licensing basis requirements in 1995, which produced incorrect operating procedures. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences Operating outside of LCO for TS 3.8.1 Condition A meets several of the reporting criteria: 10 CFR SO.73(a)(2)(i)(8): Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications 10 CFR SO.73(a)(2)(ii)(8): Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. / 10 CFR SO.73(a)(2)(v): Any event or condition that alone could have prevented the. fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are or systems that are needed to: , (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (8) Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident. The operability and availability of the Startup offsite power circuit was impacted when the 72 hour LCO forTS 3.8.1 was exceeded on the three occasions. The condition is considered u'nanalyzed since the licensing basis documentation did not fully analyze the capability of the offsite power circuits to support the worst-case licensing basis loading conditions. This condition could have prevented the 230 kV Startup offsite power circuits from supplying power to the onsite class 1 E buses and engineered safety feature systems. The delayed source of offsite power (SOO-kV System) and emergency diesel generators were operable during the period oftime for the cross-tie configuration. The availability and capability of the delayed source of offsite power and the emergency diesel generators were sufficient to accommodate and support any plant shutdown following a worst case scenario. Given the above, there was no impact on the health and safety of the public and no significalJtimpact or safety consequence of the impacted units. </TH></TR></Table><P>( </P><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) rEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBERffil </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 2 </TH><TD>015101010121715 </TD><TD>2010 </TD><TD>-1010131</TD><TD>010 </TD><TD>5IOF I 5 </TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT V.
