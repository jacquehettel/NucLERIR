On October· 13,2009,12:26 PDT, radiation detector 1-RM-25 was found to be trending up and indicating 3 Rlhr. Plant technicians removed this monitor from service upon verification of an invalid signal from the detector. On October 13,20.09,14:42 PDT, radiation monitor 1-RM-26 was found to be trending up and was removed from service ..On October 14, 2009, 0300 PDT, radiation monitor 2-RM-25 was found to be trending up and was removed from service. On October 15,2009, plant technicians determined the cause of the1-RM-25 failure to be water intrusion. On December 24, 2009, plant technicians determined the cause of the 1-RM-26 failure to also be water intrusion. Based on this finding, itwas concluded that a common mode failure had occurred and was reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii). \ </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER </P><Figure><ImageData src=""/></Figure><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER 6 </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 1 </TH><TD>o 151 0 I0 I0 I2 171 5 </TD><TD>2010 </TD><TD>-I0 I0 I 1 I -</TD><TD>01 0 </TD><TD>2 I OF I 5 </TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT I. Plant Conditions At time of discovery, Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure; Unit 2 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Description of Problem A. Background The CRVS has four distinct modes ofoperation: mode 1: normal operation mode, mode 2: fire mode, mode 3: recirculation mode, and mode 4: pressurization mode. For the mode 4 -pressurization mode, no air is supplied from, or discharged to, the outside. The suction header is supplied by recirculation flow from the control room. The control room is pressurized. CRVS mode 4 operations can occur from manual operation or automatic initiation on high radiation signal or engineered safety feature (ESF) Phase 'N Isolation. Control room air supplies for both Units are monitored by four radiation monitors, 1-RM-25, 1-RM-26, 2-RM-25, and 2-RM-26. The safety function of these radiation monitors is to shift the CRVS to mode 4 on a high radiation alarm from anyone of these detectors. B. Event Description On October 13, 2009, 11 :57 PDT, the combined DCPP CRVS transferred to its pressurization mode of operation (mode 4) due to a high radiation signal from a system radiation monitor. On'October 13,2009,'12:26 PDT, radiation monitor 1-RM-25 was found to be trending ,up and indicating 3R1hr. Plant technicians removed this monitor from service upon verification of an invalid signal from the monitor. On October 13, 2009, 14:42 PDT, radiation monitor 1-RM-26 was found to be trending up. Plant technicians removed this monitor from service upon verification of an invalid signal from the monitor. On October 14,2009,0300 PDT, radiation monitor 2-RM-25 was found to be trending up. Plant technicians removed this monitor from service upon verification of an invalid signal from the monitor. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>UCENSEE EVENT REPORT (lER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET NUMBER (2) LER NUMBER 6 PAGE (3) YEAR SEQUENTIAl.

Cause The cause of the failures was determined to be wind-driven water ,intrusion past barriers (o-rings) designed for weatherproofing of the CRVS environmental radiation monitors. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences This event was reviewed against the reporting criteria of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii) and found to be applicable. Under this regulation, &quot;Any event where a single cause or condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inqperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to: (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot; However, there were no safety consequences as a result of this event. The failure mode of the radiation detector placed the CRVS in a safe mode by activating the pressurization portion of the system and isolating the DCPP control room from external elements. / This event was reviewed to determine if it meets the criteria for a safety system functional failure. 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vi) provides that &quot;Events covered in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section may include one or more procedural personnel errors, equipment failures, and/or discovery of design, analysis, fabrication, construction, and/or procedural inadequacies. However, individual component failures need not be reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section if redundant equipment in the same system was operable and available to perform the required safety function.&quot; Although 3 of the 4 CRVS radiation detectors failed, radiation detector 2-RM-26, which is in the same system, was operable and available to perform its required safety function. Based on the foregoing, this event is not considered risk significant and did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (lER) TEXT CONTINUATION </TH></TR><TR><TH>FACILITY NAME (1) </TH><TD>DOCKET NUMBER (2) </TD><TD>LER NUMBER (6) </TD><TD>PAGE (3) </TD></TR><TR><TD>YEAR </TD><TD>SEQUENTIAL NUMBER </TD><TD>REVISION NUMBER </TD></TR><TR><TH>Diablo Canyon Unit 1 </TH><TD>o 151 0 I0 I0 I2 I7 I5 . </TD><TD>201 0 </TD><TD>-I 0 I 0·1 1 .I -</TD><TD>01 0 </TD><TD>5 I OF I 5 </TD></TR><TR><TH>TEXT V.
