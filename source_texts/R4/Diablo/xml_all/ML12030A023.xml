During a follow-up investigation, at about 2230 PDT, plant operators discovered that the integrity of the Units 1 and 2 common control room envelope (CRE) boundary was lost due to maintenance personnel removing a blank flange on the inlet duct to Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A with the dampers still inoperable (in mid-position). This condition is contrary to the requirements of Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10 &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS).&quot; Maintenance personnel reinstalled the blank flange on August 30,2011, at 0110 PDT. On August 30, 2011, at 1404 PDT, Pacific Gas and Electric Company made a late 8-hour nonemergency report (Reference NRC Event Notification 47223) under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) and (b)(3)(v)(D). Plant personnel entered this late notification into the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant corrective action system. The cause was human error by the work control shift foreman when he prematurely authorized removal of the blank flange prior to all work being complete. Insufficient controls existed to assure CRE integrity was maintained during maintenance. Corrective actions included personnel coaching, revising or creating clearances, and separate maintenance procedures for working on control room ventilation. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Plant Conditions At the time of discovery, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent power. II. Description of Problem A. Background The Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS) provides a protected environment from which operators can control the units from the common control room following an uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. The CRVS consists of two independent, redundant trains that recirculate and filter the air in the common control room envelope (CRE), and a CRE boundary that limits the inleakage of unfiltered air (one CRVS train from each unit). The CRVS is an emergency system, parts of which may also operate during normal unit operations. Upon receipt of an actuating signal, the normal air supply to the CRE is isolated, and the stream of outside ventilation air from the pressurization system and recirculated control room air is passed through a system filter. The pressurization system draws outside air from either the north end or the south end of the turbine building based upon the wind direction or the absence of releases at the inlet. The prefilters remove any large particles in the air, to prevent excessive loading of the high-efficiency particulate air filters and charcoal adsorbers [ADS]. The CRVS is designed to maintain a habitable environment in the Units 1 and 2 common CRE for the duration of the most severe Design Basis Accident without exceeding a 5 rem whole body dose or its equivalent to any part of the body. This basis is consistent with General Design Criteria 19, dated 1971. B. Event Description On August 29, 2011, at about 1130 PDT, prior to reporting off a clearance to perform maintenance on Unit 2 Control Room Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A, maintenance personnel received permission from the Work Control Shift Foreman (WCSF) to remove the blank flange from the inlet duct [DUCT] to the dampers [CDMP]. This blank flange was maintaining the integrity of the CRE boundary while Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A were inoperable during maintenance. At about 1400 PDT, plant personnel completed maintenance on Unit 2 Control Room Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A and planned on performing static testing of the CRE the next morning. At about 1724 PDT, an operator attempted to reposition the dampers from the control room, but was unable to do so. During a follow-up investigation, at about 2230 PDT, operators determined that the flange had been removed prematurely and Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A were still inoperable awaiting stroke testing by electrical maintenance. Maintenance personnel reinstalled the flange on August 30,2011, at 0110 PDT to meet the required actions associated with Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 O.B. The loss of CRE boundary created an unanalyzed condition that could have prevented the CRVS from mitigating the exposure of control room personnel to the consequences of an accident. On August 30, 2011, at 1404 PDT, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) made a late 8-hour nonemergency report (Reference NRC Event Notification 47223) under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) and (b)(3)(v)(D). Plant personnel entered this late notification into the Diablo Canyon Nuclear power Plant (DCPP) corrective action system. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Status of Inoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event CRVS Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A were inoperable in mid-position. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected Inoperability ofthe CRE rendered both Units 1 and 2 CRVS trains inoperable. However, the CRVS trains remained capable of performing their normal ventilation functions. E. Method of Discovery An operator attempted to reposition the dampers from the control room, but was unable to do so. F. Operator Actions Plant Personnel took the required actions associated with TS 3.7.10.B and reinstalled the blank flange on August 30, 2011, at 0110 PDT. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause of the Problem A. Immediate Cause Control room boundary integrity was lost due to maintenance personnel removing a blank flange on the inlet duct to the Unit 2 CRVS Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A with the dampers still inoperable and in mid-position. B. Cause The cause was human error by the work control shift foreman when he prematurely authorized removal of the blank flange prior to all work being complete. Insufficient controls existed to assure that the CRE integrity was maintained during maintenance. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences Maintenance personnel removed the blank flange from the upstream side of Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A for about 12 hours. During this time, the ability ofthe CRVS to protect operators from a post-accident release of airborne radiation was compromised. However, the probability that a core-damaging accident could occur and require actuation of the pressurization mode of control room ventilation during this period of time was extremely low (less than lE-07 during the 12-hour window). Therefore, this event resulted in an insignificant increase in radiological risk to the control room operators. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Corrective Actions A. Immediate Correction Actions A clearance was created for CRVS Dampers MOD-2 and MOD-2A to track the removal of the blank flange. B. Corrective Actions The WCSF was coached and the PG&amp;E personal accountability process applied. PG&amp;E also took the following actions: -Revised or created individual clearances for the installation and removal of CRVS blank flanges for associated dampers. -Maintenance instructions were added or enhanced stating that CRVS blank flanges shall not be removed until the shift foreman has determined that all affected equipment is operable and authorizes removal of the flanges. -Separate maintenance instructions were created to control the installation or removal of CRVS blank flanges that render the system inoperable. -A new procedure will be created for maintenance on control room ventilation.
