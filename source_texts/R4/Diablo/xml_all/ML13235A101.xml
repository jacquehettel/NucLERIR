Subsequent cleanup ofthe boric acid accumulation revealed an active leak of3 drops per minute. A visual inspection identified that the source ofthe leak was a circumferential crack on the socket weld. DCPP determined that system vibration induced a low-stress, high-cycle fatigue which caused the socket weld to fail. DCPP replaced the socket weld. The new weld has improved fatigue resistance over the original, equal-leg socket weld. Additionally, DCPP will install a new support to reduce the chances of piping vibration amplification by increasing its natural frequencies to significantly higher than the current resonant frequencies. This condition did not adversely affect the health and safety ofthe public. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Plant Conditions At the time ofthe event, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor [RCT] power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Problem Description A. Background The function ofthe emergency core cooling system (ECCS) is to provide core cooling and negative reactivity to ensure that the reactor core is protected after any of the following accidents: a. loss-of-coolant accident, non-isolable coolant leakage greater than the capability ofthe normal charging system [CB]; b. rod ejection accident; c. loss-of-secondary-coolant accident, including uncontrolled steam release or loss of feedwater; and d. steam generator tube rupture. The addition ofnegative reactivity is designed primarily for the loss-of-secondary-coolant accident where primary cooldown could add enough positive reactivity to achieve criticality and return to significant reactor power. The ECCS consists ofthree separate subsystems: centrifugal charging (high head) [BQ], safety injection (intermediate head), and residual heat removal (RHR) (low head) [BP]. Each subsystem consists of 2 redundant, 100 percent capacity trains. The design function of relief valve [RV] RHR-I-RV-8708 is to protect the RHR discharge piping from exceeding its design pressure rating. The inlet pipe to the valve is connected to a 12-inch RHR header line, which provides a flow path for injection to Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] Hot Legs 1 and 2. This line is occasionally used to fill the reactor cavity during refueling outages. The normal flow path for shutdown cooling (Modes 4 and 5) does not use this line. B. Event Description On June 25, 20l3, during a walkdown ofthe Unit 1 containment, maintenance personnel noted an accumulation of boric acid on the inlet pipe to relief valve RHR-I-RV-8708. The problem was entered into the corrective action program. Subsequent cleanup ofthe boric acid accumulation revealed an active leak of3 drops per minute (dpm). A visual inspection identified a circumferential crack on the socket weld. The active boric acid leak was located on the common header from the RHR pump [P] discharge to RCS Hot Legs 1 and 2. The active boric acid leak could not be isolated. Both trains ofthe RHR system were declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.0.3 was entered on June 25, 2013 at 2158 PDT. DCPP made a 4-hour report to the NRC about the TS-required shutdown of Unit 1 (NRC Event Notification Number 49148). </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Status ofInoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event None. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. E. Method of Discovery During a walk down ofthe Unit 1 containment, maintenance personnel noted an accumulation of boric acid on the inlet pipe to relief valve RHR-I-RV-S70S. Subsequent cleanup ofthe boric acid accumulation revealed an active leak of 3 dpm. A visual inspection identified that the source ofthe leak was a circumferential crack on the socket weld. F. Operator Actions Operators declared both RHR trains inoperable. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause ofthe Problem DCPP determined that the socket weld on the inlet piping to relief valve RHR-I-RV-S70S failed due to low-stress, high-cycle fatigue (from operation-induced system vibration) and a lack of fusion in the weld root. The crack initiated at a stress riser and propagated due to cyclical loading. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences DCPP assessed the Unit 1 risk significance of a leak in the vent line ofthe RHR supply line to the Hot Leg 1 and 2 supply lines. This assessment concluded that the incremental conditional core damage probability was less than 1.OE~06/year. Therefore, the event is not considered risk significant and did not adversely affect the health and safety ofthe pUblic. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions DCPP replaced the socket weld on June 27, 2013. The new weld uses a 2:1-leg ratio fillet weld, which has improved fatigue resistance over the original equal-leg socket weld. This weld configuration has been </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

B. Other Corrective Actions DCPP will install new, rigid-lateral support(s) on the discharge line from relief valve RHR-1-RV-8708. The new support(s) will reduce the chances of piping vibration amplification by increasing its natural frequencies to significantly higher than the current resonant frequencies. DCPP will also assess extent of cause for additional socket welds in susceptible locations. VI. Additional Information A. Failed Components DCPP discovered a circumferential crack on the socket weld on the inlet to relief valve RHR-1-RV-870S. B. Previous Similar Events DCPP -On February 8, 1999, an operator observed a leak on the weld for chemical and volume control system valve CVCS-2-839 while on routine rounds. The cause ofthe leak was determined to be high-cycle fatigue ofthe socket-welded connection due to degraded positive displacement pump operation causing excessive vibration of the piping near the pumps, which led to the growth of through-wall cracks. The corrective action was to remove the valve/pipe assembly and install a plug in the fitting. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
