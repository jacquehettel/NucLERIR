Operators declared the Units 1 and 2 CRVS actuation instrumentation and CRVS inoperable and entered Technical Specifications (TS) 3.3.7, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS) Actuation Instrumentation,&quot; and TS 3.7.10, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS),&quot; respectively. PG&amp;E reports this condition in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii). Following troubleshooting activities in response to this event, PG&amp;E developed, issued, and implemented a design change to modify the logic scheme for the CRVS pressurization fans to bypass the opposite unit pressure switch interlocks for a running CRVS pressurization fan. Investigation following the initial failure determined that these interlocks were not necessary. PG&amp;E performed an apparent cause evaluation and concluded that the loss of CRVS was due to inadequate design controls. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Plant Conditions At the time of discovery, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power. II. Problem Description A. Background The Unit 1 and 2 common control room ventilation system (CRVS) provides a protected environment from which operators can control the units from the common control room (CR) following an uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. The CRVS consists oftwo trains (one CRVS train from each unit) that recirculate and filter the air in the common control room envelope (CRE), and a CRE boundary that limits the in-leakage of unfiltered air. A CRVS train is operable when the associated: 1. main supply fan [FAN] (one), filter booster fan (one) and pressurization fan (one) are operable; 2. high-efficiency particulate-air (HEPA) filters [FLT] and charcoal adsorbers [ADS] are not excessively restricting flow, and are capable of performing their filtration functions; and 3. ductwork [DUCT], valves [V], and dampers [DMP] are operable, and air circulation can be maintained. Each train is comprised oftwo redundant, full-capacity, active components so that each train is composed oftwo subtrains. Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS),&quot; for the CRVS pertains to the two CRVS trains rather than the four subtrains. Either ofthe two redundant subtrains is manually selected via a switch in the CR, with either subtrain in each unit capable of satisfying the CRVS train operability requirement. The CRVS is an emergency system, parts ofwhich may also operate during normal unit operations. Upon receipt of an actuating signal, the normal air supply to the CRE is isolated, and the stream ofoutside ventilation air from the pressurization system and recirculated CR air is passed through a system filter. The pressurization system draws outside air from either the north end or the south end ofthe turbine building [NM]. The prefilters remove any large particles in the air to prevent excessive loading ofthe HEP A filters and charcoal adsorbers. The CRVS is designed to maintain a habitable environment in the Units 1 and 2 common CRE for the duration of the most severe design basis accident (DBA) without exceeding 5-rem whole body dose or its equivalent to any part ofthe body (calculated over 30 days). On October 4 and 10,2012, in response to a prompt operability assessment on the CRE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) completed modifications to the Units 1 and 2 CRVS, respectively, by adding a back-draft damper in each unit's CRVS recirculation line. These dampers minimize the amount of unfiltered air entering the control room when one train is not in operation. On October 11, 2012, following the damper installation, plant staff performed routine surveillance test procedure (STP) I-18Ml, &quot;Control Room Air Intake Monitor Functional Test (RM-25 and 26),&quot; with satisfactory results. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) </TH><TH/><TH>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

This flow balancing maximized the recirculation flow through </P><P>the operating booster fan and thus minimized the radiation dose to the CR operators. As part ofthe development </P><P>ofTP TB-12007, PG&amp;E created engineering calculation HVAC-2012-03, &quot;CRVS Damper Throttling Model.&quot; </P><P>This calculation assessed flow rates and pressures throughout the CRVS in the various operating configurations. </P><P>The flow model used in the calculation determined system performance. </P><P>B. Event Description </P><P>On November 27,2012, at 2038 PST, while performing a functional test ofthe CRVS pressurization system in </P><P>accordance with STP I-118A, PG&amp;E identified that none ofthe four CRVS pressurization fans would </P><P>continuously operate ifthey started in response to a safety injection or CR atmosphere intake radiation actuation </P><P>signal. Operators declared the Units 1 and 2 CRVS actuation instrumentation inoperable and entered </P><P>TS 3.3.7, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS) Actuation Instrumentation.&quot; As directed by TS 3.3.7, </P><P>Condition B, operators also declared one train ofCRVS inoperable and entered TS 3.7.l0, Condition A. PG&amp;E </P><P>reports this condition in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented </P><P>fulfillment ofa safety function to mitigate the consequences ofan accident, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii) as a common </P><P>cause inoperability of independent trains needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident, and </P><P>10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS. </P><P>Initial troubleshooting efforts determined that the recent installation of back-draft dampers and post-modification </P><P>CRVS flow balancing resulted in a higher static head in CRVS common ducting during Mode 4 operation. This </P><P>caused pressurization fan cycling due to actuation of the system pressure switch(es) [63][PS]. Original </P><P>pressurization system design utilized pressure switches to provide interlocks which precluded running two fans </P><P>simultaneously by causing the nonassociated fan to shut off.. This was originally designed to protect against over </P><P>pressurization ofthe system ducting. Soon after initial system construction, the pressurization fans were modified </P><P>such that over-pressurization was no longer possible, but the pressure interlocks remained in the actuation </P><P>circuitry. Per design basis document Design Criteria Memorandum (DCM) S-23F, &quot;Control Room HV AC </P><P>System,&quot; the pressure switches were only identified as providing a low pressure permissive to start a redundant </P><P>fan. Therefore, engineers involved in the damper modification and flow rebalancing did not recognize that the </P><P>same pressure switches also provided an over-pressurization interlock. Following these modifications, the </P><P>pressurization fan that was selected to run increased static pressure in ducting downstream ofthe pressurization </P><P>fans enough to exceed the setpoint of all the pressure switch( es) that indicate their associated fan is running. Thus, </P><P>this condition caused the operating fan to shut down, which lowered the common-header static pressure below the </P><P>setpoint ofthe pressure switch. This reduction of static pressure in the common header resulted in the restart of </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 3GGA (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Thus, with the on-and-off cycling ofthe pressurization fan, Mode 4 would not be sustained upon a Phase A containment isolation or radiation monitor actuation. However, Mode 4 CRVS operation could be sustained by control room operator manual action taken as directed by DCPP Emergency Operating Procedure E-O, &quot;Reactor Trip or Safety Injection,&quot; Appendix E, &quot;ESF Auto Actions, Secondary and Auxiliaries Status.&quot; A review ofthe results of calculation HVAC-20l2-03 indicated that the predicted pressures near the location of the pressure switches were higher than the pressure switches' high setpoint of2 pounds per square inch (psig). The measured pressure at each pressure switch after this event was very close to the predicted pressures calculated in HVAC-20l2-03. DCPP design calculation HVAC-96-0l, &quot;To Determine CRVS Operation Characteristics under Various Operating Conditions,&quot; issued in 2008, assessed the CRVS configuration prior to the flow balancing activities. This calculation indicated that the predicted pressures at the pressure switches were lower than the 2 psig high-pressure setpoint. Since STP I-118A was successfully performed on October 12, 2012, following the installation ofthe back-draft dampers, PG&amp;E concluded that the back-draft damper installation had not contributed to this event. PG&amp;E reviewed the back-draft damper modification and flow balancing activities and found no additional unintended consequences. In addition, PG&amp;E created a testing matrix ofall tests that are performed on the CRVS so that testing following implementation of a design change to modifY the logic scheme for the pressurization fans provided a very high level of certainty that all system functions are tested.

Cause ofthe Problem PG&amp;E concluded that as a result of flow balancing activities, the throttling of some CRVS dampers caused the pressure in the common header to exceed the high-pressure setpoint ofthe system pressure switches. This configuration was not prevented because the functions ofthe pressure switches and CRVS interlocks had never been adequately described in DCM S-23F, resulting in inadequate design controls being established following system modification. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences PG&amp;E concluded that the failure ofthe CRVS pressurization function does not impact mitigation of any ofthe initiating events that affect core damage frequency modeled in the probabilistic risk assessment and thus a failure ofthe pressurization function does not directly contribute to an increase ofthe core damage frequency or large early release frequency. This event did not result in failure of any equipment or a radiological release to plant personnel or the public. Therefore, this event did not adversely affect the health and safety ofthe public. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions Following verification that the high-pressure function ofthe pressure switches were no longer required, PG&amp;E developed, issued, and implemented a design change to modify the logic scheme for the CRVS pressurization fans to bypass the opposite unit pressure switch interlocks for a running pressurization fan. This aligned the physical configuration ofthe pressure switch logic and the design basis. descriptions ofthe pressure switches in DCM S-23F. B. Other Corrective Actions As part ofthe investigation into the PG&amp;E design basis document DCM S-23F, PG&amp;E discovered other legacy design functions issues that need to be corrected. These findings have been entered into PG&amp;E's corrective action program. VI. Additional Information A. Failed Components None. B. Previous Similar Events None. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
