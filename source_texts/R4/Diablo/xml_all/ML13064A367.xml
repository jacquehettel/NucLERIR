Specifically, when TS 3.4.12 was applicable, DCPP operated with more than one centrifugal charging pump (CCP) capable of injecting into the reactor coolant system. DCPP determined this condition was reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). The noncompliance was identified based on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission TS Interpretation letter dated January 3,2013, to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Company. DCPP concluded that it had not complied with TS 3.4.12 since it replaced the positive displacement pump (PDP) with a CCP in Unit 1 (2005) and in Unit 2 (2007). Immediate corrective actions in response to this event included revising the affected procedures to ensure compliance with TS 3.4.12. The apparent cause for this event includes a deficiency in DCPP's 10 CFR 50.59 procedure and human error. The procedure did not provide guidance regarding proposed deSign changes that may maintain the original intent but create new literal compliance issues. The human error occurred when DCPP staff interpreted that the operability requirements outlined in TS 3.4.12 as being equivalent with respect to the PDP to CCP design change. Corrective actions included revising the associated 10 CFR 50.59 procedure, revising the Current Licensing Basis Determination Procedure and providing a lessons-learned discussion to the staff. This event did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Plant Conditions Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1, with reactor power at approximately 100 percent. II Description ofthe Problem A. Background The low temperature overpressure protection system (LTOP) controls reactor coolant system (RCS) [AB] pressure at low temperatures so the integrity ofthe reactor coolant pressure boundary is not compromised by violating the pressure and temperature (PIT) limits of 10 CFR 50, Appendix G. The potential for vessel over-pressurization is most acute when the RCS is water solid during plant shutdown conditions. At this time, a pressure fluctuation can occur more quickly than an operator can react to relieve the condition. Exceeding the RCS PIT limits could cause brittle cracking ofthe reactor vessel. Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) 3.4.3, RCS PIT Limits, requires administrative control ofRCS pressure and temperature during heat-up and cool-down to prevent exceeding the pressure temperature limits report (PTLR) limits. TS 3.4.12 LCO 3.4.12 assures RCS overpressure protection by limiting coolant input capability to no safety injection (SI) [BQ, P] pumps and a maximum of one centrifugal charging pump (CCP) [CB, P] being capable of injecting into the RCS, and isolating the RCS accumulators. However, CCPs in excess ofthe above limitations can be momentarily capable of injection into the RCS for swapping of inservice CCPs. Although not addressed in LCO 3.4.12, the plant design includes two emergency core cooling system (ECCS) CCPs and also a third CCP (CCP-3). Operation of CCP-3 is controlled administratively in accordance with the PTLR. TS 3.4.12 is applicable during the following plant modes of operation: -Mode 4, when any RCS cold leg temperature is less than or equal to L TOP arming temperature specified in the PTLR (approximately 280 degrees). -Mode 5 -Mode 6, when the reactor vessel head is on and the vessel head closure bolts are not fully de-tensioned. The LTOP system for pressure relief consists oftwo Class I power operated relief valves (PORVs) [AB, RV] with reduced lift settings, or a depressurized RCS and an RCS vent of sufficient size. Two RCS Class I PORV s are required for redundancy. One RCS Class I PORV has adequate relieving capability to prevent over pressurization from the allowable coolant input capability. DCPP L TOP analysis concluded that RCS limits would not be exceeded given that 1) all SI pumps were secured, 2) one ECCS CCP was secured, 3) all SI accumulators were isolated, and 4) CCP-3 was aligned for LTOP operation prior to entering the L TOP mode of operation. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

LTOP Operating Experience and Impact on DCPP Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Company (WCNOC) has a charging system and licensing history similar to DCPP's in that it originally had a normal-use reciprocating charging pump and two ECCS CCPs. WCNOC replaced its reciprocating pump with a CCP (similar to DCPP) without revising its LTOP TS. Similar to DCPP, WCNOC's LTOP TS specifies that only one CCP can be capable ofinjecting to the RCS while LTOP is required to be operable. On January 3, 2013, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a TS interpretation clarifying that the WCNOC TS 3.4.12 does not permit more than a single CCP to be capable of injecting into the RCS while L TOP is required to be operable. C. Event Description On January 3,2013, at 19:32 PST, DCPP reviewed the NRC's interpretation ofWCNOC TS 3.4.12 and determined that DCPP had been in non-compliance with TS 3.4.12 (when applicable) since the positive displacement pump (PDP) replacement modifications in Unit 1 in 2005 and in Unit 2 in 2007. DCPP determined this condition was reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's TS. PG&amp;E maintained CCP configurations in accordance with the L TOP analysis and the PTLR by having procedural requirements as indicated below: A. with RCS temperature below 280 degrees F and above 156 degrees F, two CCPs are capable of injecting into the RCS, one ofwhich is CCP-3 aligned for LTOP operation. B. with RCS temperature at or below 156 degrees F, only one CCP is capable of injecting into the RCS. The following is a list ofthe approximate dates in the prior 3 years in which DCPP relied on L TOP and was in configuration A listed above and not in compliance with TS 3.4.12: Unit 1: Refueling outage 16 (10/03/10 at 06:50 -10/03/10 at 17:40) (11102/10 at 07:30 -11105110 at 0130) Refueling outage 17 (04/22/12 at 22:20 04/23112 at 17:40) (06/08/12 at 13:50 -06/10/12 at 16:00) Unit 2: Refueling outage 16 (05/01111 at 08:50 -05/01111 at 22:00) (05/31111 at 09:40 -06/02111 at 12:50) </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Status ofInoperable Structures, Systems or Components that contributed to the Event None. E. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. F. Method ofDiscovery This condition was discovered during a review ofoperating experience associated with the NRC's TS Interpretation letter dated January 3, 2012, indicating that TS 3.4.12 does not permit operation ofmore than a single CCP while L TOP is required to be operable. G. Operator Actions None. H. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause ofthe Event A. The two apparent causes identified with this condition are summarized below: 1. A deficiency in DCPP's 10 CFR 50.59 procedure was identified as the apparent cause. The procedure did not provide guidance regarding proposed design changes that may maintain the original intent but create new literal compliance issues. 2. Human Error -The DCPP staff interpreted the operability requirements outlined in TS 3.4.12 as being equivalent with respect to the PDP to CCP design change. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The plant configuration controls using the new CCP ensured DCPP operated within the limits ofthe LTOP analysis, ensuring that the (PIT) limits of 10 CFR 50, Appendix G would not be exceeded. Nuclear or radiological safety was not affected. This event had no impact to safety ofthe public or station personnel. This event did not impact the reliability ofplant operation or production capacity. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
