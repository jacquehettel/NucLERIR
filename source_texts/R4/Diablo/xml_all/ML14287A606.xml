As part of subsequent inspections to determine whether a similar condition existed on any of the other Unit 1 or Unit 2 EDGs, a degraded capscrew was identified on EDG 2-3 cylinder 8L. No capscrew issues were identified on the Unit 1 EDGs or on Unit 2 EDG 2-1. EDG 2-3 was declared inoperable at 1631 on August 14, 2014, resulting in two of three EDGs being inoperable at the same time, which requires ensuring at least two EDGs are operable within 2 hours, or be in Mode 3 within the following 6 hours. Although the capscrew on EDG 2-3 was successfully replaced within 2 hours, during fuel system fill and vent following corrective maintenance, a fuel oil leak from the belt driven fuel oil booster pump occurred. Because repairs of EDG 2-3 could not be completed within the time permitted by Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 for two EDGs inoperable, a Unit 2 plant shutdown commenced. On August 14, 2014 at 2351 hours, Unit 2 entered Mode 3. PG&amp;E will provide the event cause and corrective actions once the associated cause evaluation is complete.

Plant Conditions Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Problem Description A. Background Each Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) unit has three emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [DG] that provide vital backup power to three electrical buses [BU] to mitigate the consequences of a design basis accident (DBA) whenever normal and backup offsite power sources [EK] are unavailable. DCPP EDGs are designed to function so that a single failure of any EDG will not jeopardize the capability of the remaining EDGs to start and provide power to operate the shutdown systems required to mitigate any DBA condition. B. Event Description On August 13, 2014, while performing scheduled maintenance on Unit 2 EDG 2-2, Pacific Gas and Electric Company identified a failed Inlet-to-Fuel-Header capscrew on engine cylinder 1 L. As part of the DCPP EDG design, two capscrews connect each injection pump fuel inlet to the fuel header. The fuel inlet supplies lowpressure fuel to the fuel injection pumps, which supplies high-pressure fuel to each cylinder. In the event of a capscrew failure, a potential leak path is created. As part of subsequent inspections to determine whether a similar condition existed on any of the other Unit 1 or Unit 2 EDGs, a degraded capscrew was identified on EDG 2-3 cylinder 8L. No capscrew issues were identified on the Unit 1 EDGs or on Unit 2 EDG 2-1. EDG 2-3 was declared inoperable at 1631 on August 14, 2014, resulting in two of three EDGs being inoperable at the same time, which requires ensuring at least two EDGs are operable within 2 hours, or be in Mode 3 within the following 6 hours. Although the capscrew on EDG 2-3 was successfully replaced within 2 hours, during fuel system fill and vent following corrective maintenance, a fuel oil leak from the belt driven fuel oil booster pump occurred. Because repairs of EDG 2-3 could not be completed within the time permitted by Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 for two EDGs inoperable, a Unit 2 plant shutdown commenced. On August 14, 2014, at 2351 hours, Unit 2 entered Mode 3. C.

The EDG 2-3 degraded capscrew was identified during the associated extent of condition investigation performed on all the other EDGs. F. Operator Actions With two EDGs inoperable, a Unit 2 plant shutdown commenced in accordance with TS requirements, with Unit 2 entering Mode 3 at 2351 hours on August 14, 2014. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause of the Problem PG&amp;E is conducting a cause evaluation on this event and will submit a supplemental LER documenting the results of this investigation once it is complete. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences In accordance with the TS, Unit 2 was safely shutdown. Following completion of the cause evaluation for this event, the associated safety consequences assessment will be included in the supplement to this LER. This event did not adversely affect the health or safety of the public. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions 1. The degraded capscrew on EDG 2-3 was replaced, the fuel oil booster pump leak was repaired, and the EDG was successfully restored to Operable condition on August 15, 2014 at 1831 hours. 2. The failed capscrew on EDG 2-2 was replaced as part of its scheduled maintenance window. B. Additional Corrective Actions Additional corrective actions associated with this event will be discussed in the LER supplement, following completion of the associated cause evaluation. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Additional Information A. Previous Similar Events On February 9,2011, a fuel leak was found on EDG 2-1 during a routine test run. The disassembly investigation determined that the leak had originated from the cylinder 9L special capscrews. Further disassembly determined that one of the special capscrews was fully cracked across the entire cross-section of the threaded portion of the bolt. Metallurgic analysis identified that the failure mechanism was high-cycle fatigue with a slow propagation of the crack due to a low stress in the joint. It was concluded that without proper special capscrew preloading, these special capscrews would be susceptible to high-cycle fatigue failure. As an extent of condition corrective action, all Original Equipment Manufacturer ALCO special capscrews were removed and replaced with FM-G5E special capscrews in the Unit 1 and Unit 2 EDGs. These removed special capscrews were magnetic particle tested to determine if any crack initiation existed. 208 special capscrews tested satisfactory, satisfying the initial sampling population with no unsatisfactory findings. In determining the apparent cause of the failure, a system engineer from Salem Nuclear Generating Station was contacted about a similar event. Salem had two failures of the special capscrews and it was concluded to be caused by the special capscrew being inadequately tensioned before reaching the end of the threads in the blind tapped hole. Measurements of the EDG 2-1 cylinder 9L capscrew length, flange thickness, and tapped blind hole thread depth determined that less-than-adequate thread depth was available to ensure proper special capscrew preloading and flange gasket crush. For this reason, special capscrew blind holes were bottom-tapped on all six EDGs in the fuel header to ensure sufficient thread engagement as a corrective action. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
