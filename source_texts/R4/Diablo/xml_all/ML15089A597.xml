This resulted in the valid start of all Unit 1 and 2 emergency diesel generators (EDGs), three per unit. All EDGs successfully started, but did not load since all associated electrical buses remained energized by auxiliary power. All systems operated as designed with no problems observed. The 230 kV oftsite power source is the only offsite power system designed to be immediately available following an accident. However, the safety-related onsite EDGs would have provided power to mitigate the consequences of an accident while the 230 kV system was unavailable. On October 31, 2014, at 23:07 PDT, PG&amp;E made an 8-hour nonemergency report to the NRC. The 230 kV offsite power was declared operable on November 1, 2014, at 02:29 PDT. PG&amp;E completed a root cause evaluation and determined that inadequate organizational oversight and alignment resulted in ineffective and untimely execution of planned corrective actions intended to prevent excessive buildup of environmental contaminants on the 230 kV insulators.

Plant Conditions Just prior to, and following, the event, Unit 1 operated in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. Unit 2 operated in Mode 4 (Hot Shutdown) at opercent power with power supplied from the 500 kV auxiliary power source. II. Problem Description A. Background The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) electrical systems are designed to ensure an adequate supply of electrical power to all essential auxiliary equipment during normal operation and under accident conditions. Nonvital4 kV alternating current (AC) auxiliary buses [BU] are energized by either offsite power or power from the main generator. Vital AC buses [EA] have an additional available source, which includes onsite power delivered by emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [OG]. The electrical systems are designed so that failure of anyone electrical device will not prevent operation of the minimum required engineered safety feature (ESF) equipment. OCPP offsite power is supplied by two systems that are physically and electrically separated and independent of each other: (1) a 230 kV system [EK] and (2) a 500 kV system [EK]. The 230 kV system provides offsite startup and standby power, and provides an immediately available source of offsite power to the 4 kV system. To make power available to the vital 4 kV buses, the 230 kV system provides power to Startup Transformers (SUT)[EA][XFMR] 1-1 and 2-1 (230 kV to 12 kV), which then feeds SUT 1-2 and 2-2 (12 kV to 4 kV). The 500 kV system provides for transmission of the plant's power output, and is also available as a delayed access source of offsite power after the main generator is disconnected. To produce onsite power, each unit has three EOGs, which supply power to the 4 kV vital AC buses when 230 kV startup power is unavailable or voltage degrades below a point at which required ESF loads would be operable. The EDGs start in standby mode on loss of 230 kV startup power. After the EOGs start, they supply power to their respective vital bus if the buses are deenergized. If the vital buses are not deenergized, the EOGs continue to run in standby mode, ready to provide power if required. B. Event Description On October 31,2014, at 17:40 PDT, during a medium to heavy rain, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) lost its offsite 230 kV offsite power source at OCPP due to an insulator flashover in the 230 kV switchyard, resulting in the valid anticipatory start of all Unit 1 and 2 EDGs, three per unit. This is reportable, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an event that resulted in the valid actuation of EOGs. All EDGs successfully started, but did not load since all associated electrical buses remained energized by auxiliary power. All systems operated as designed with no problems observed. However, the safety-related onsite EDGs would have provided power to mitigate the consequences of an accident while the 230 kV system was unavailable. On October 31, 2014, at 23:07 PDT, PG&amp;E made an 8-hour nonemergency report to the NRC (Reference NRC Event Notification Number 50586). The 230 kV offsite power was declared operable on November 1, 2014, at 02:29 PDT. C. Status of Inoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event None. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRCFORM366A (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. E. Method of Discovery Licensed plant operators immediately recognized the event by alarms and indications received in the control room. F. Operator Actions On November 1, 2014, operators restored the Unit 1 and Unit 2 EDGs, respectively, to standby service. The 230 kV offsite power system was declared operable on November 1,2014, at 02:29 PDT. G. Safety System Responses All Unit 1 and Unit 2 EDGs started as designed with no problems observed. III. Cause of the Problem A. Root Cause: PG&amp;E completed a root cause evaluation and determined that inadequate organizational oversight and alignment resulted in ineffective and untimely execution of planned corrective actions intended to prevent excessive buildup of environmental contaminants on the 230 kV insulators. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The 230 kV startup power is a standby system. Its loss was due to a degraded condition in the 230kv switchyard. This event did not create a transient at the plant. A Significance Determination Process evaluation allows taking credit for the actual plant configuration at the time of an event. With the successful start of all EDGs upon the loss of startup power, the vital AC power supply to all emergency core cooling system loads would have been maintained. A bounding analysis was performed and resulted in an incremental core damage and incremental large early release probabilities that were well below their respective acceptance criteria. V. Corrective Actions 1. A new Project Manager has been designated to implement activities to effectively prioritize action plans into one comprehensive strategy for recovery between Transmission and DCPP projects. 2. Revised the Transmission &amp; Distribution Interface procedure to ensure a Single point of contact with ownership and oversight over switchyards affecting DCPP reliability to strengthen execution of maintenance and corrective actions. VI. Additional Information A Failed Components None. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (01-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Previous Similar Events On May 12, 2007, at 10:25 PDT, during a refueling outage at DCPP, with Unit 1 in no Mode (core offloaded to the spent fuel pool) and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, an EDG system actuation was initiated on loss of 230 kV startup power supply due to an offsite transmission system insulator failure resulting in a phase to ground short and unanticipated protective relay response. Two Unit 1 EDGs started and loaded to provide onsite power. Unit 1 had one EDG and auxiliary offsite power cleared for maintenance. All three Unit 2 EDGs started as required, but did not load since all associated buses remained energized by auxiliary power. On May 12, 2007, at 14:30 PDT, operators restored startup power to the site. On May 12, 2007, at 15:09 PDT, operators made a nonemergency event notification (EN 43360) in accordance with 10 CFR 50. 72(b)(3)(iv)(A). On June 23, 2013, at 21 :20 PDT, PG&amp;E lost its 230 kV offsite power source at the DCPP, due to an offsite transmission system insulator failure resulting in a phase to ground short and unanticipated protective relay response. This resulted in the valid start of all Unit 1 and 2 EDGs, three per unit. All EDGs successfully started, but did not load since all associated buses remained energized by auxiliary power. All systems operated as designed with no problems observed. The 230 kV offsite power source is the only offsite power system designed to be immediately available following an accident. However, the safety-related onsite EDGs would have provided power to mitigate the consequences of an accident while the 230 kV system was unavailable. On June 24, 2013, at 01 :35 PDT, PG&amp;E made an 8-hour nonemergency event notification. C. Industry Reports None. </TH></TR></Table></TaggedPDF-doc>
