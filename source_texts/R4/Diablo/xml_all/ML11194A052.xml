PLANT CONDITIONS When the event occurred, Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent power. II. DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM A. BACKGROUND The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) electrical systems are designed to ensure an adequate supply of electrical power to all essential auxiliary equipment during normal operation and under accident conditions. Nonvital 4.16 kV alternating current (AC) auxiliary buses are energized by either offsite power or power from the main generator. Vital AC buses lEA) IBU) have an additional available source, which includes on site power delivered by diesel generators. The electrical systems are designed so that failure of anyone electrical device will not prevent operation of the minimum required engineered safety feature (ESF) equipment. General Design Criteria (GDC) 17 states, in part, &quot;An onsite electric power system and an offsite electric power system shall be provided to permit functioning of structures, systems, and components important to safety. The safety function for each system (assuming the other system is not functioning) shall be to provide sufficient capacity and capability to assure that (1) specified acceptable fuel design limits and design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational occurrences and (2) the core is cooled and containment integrity and other vital functions are maintained in the event of postulated accidents.&quot; DCPP offsite power is supplied by two systems that are physically and electrically separated and independent of each other: a 230 kV system and a 500 kV system. This satisfies requirements established by GDC 17. The 230 kV system provides startup and standby power, and is immediately available following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) to assure that core cooling, containment integrity, and other vital safety functions are maintained. To make power available to the vital 4.16 kV buses, the 230 kV system provides power to Startup Transformer (SUT)(EAIIXFMR) I-I (230 kV to 12 kV), which then feeds SUT 1-2 (12 kV to 4.16 kV). The 500 kV system provides for transmission of the plant's power output, and is also available as a delayed access source of offsite power after the main generator is disconnected. Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 requires two qualified circuits between the offsite transmission network and the onsite Class IE AC Electrical Power Distribution System. Ifone required offsite circuit is inoperable, TS Action 3.8.1 is entered and the following actions are required: DCPP must perform Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.1 for required operable offsite circuit within 1 hour and once every 8 hours thereafter, and restore required offsite circuit to operable status within 72 hours and 14 days from discovery offailure to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO). To produce onsite power, each unit has three emergency diesel generators (EDGs)IEKIIDG], which supply power to the 4.16 kV vital AC buses when power is unavailable or voltage degrades below a point at which required ESF loads would be operable. After EDGs have started, they will supply power to their respective vital bus if the buses are deenergized. If the vital buses are not deenergized, the EDGs will continue to run in standby mode, ready to provide power if required. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

EVENT DESCRIPTION At the time of the event, Unit 2 Sixteenth Refueling Outage (2RI6) was ongoing and modifications were being made to the 230 kV startup system. On May 17,2011, at 0954 PDT, while work was being performed on a relay panel containing components for both units, the 230 kV Line Differential Relay 287 actuated. This opened the 12 kV Feeder to Startup Bus Breaker 52VU12 and resulted in a loss of power to the Unit 1 12 kV startup bus. The isolation of the offsite standby power source, and subsequent loss of power to startup feeder breakers for the 4.16 kV operating buses, caused all Unit 1 EDGs to start in standby mode. The EDGs started as designed with no problems observed. All Unit 1 EDGs were shutdown and returned to auto. SUTs 1-1 and 1-2 were returned to service, and on May 17,2011, at 1125 PDT, Unit 1 startup power was declared operable. Startup power on Unit 2 was cleared due to the maintenance activities being performed; therefore, it was unaffected by the event. On May 17,2011, at 1542, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) made an 8-hour nonemergency r~port (Reference NRC Event Notification 46856) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). c. STATUS OF INOPERABLE STRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT There were no inoperable structures, systems, or components that contributed to the event. All systems functioned as designed. D. OTHER SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS AFFECTED No other systems or secondary functions were affected. E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY The event was immediately known to licensed plant operators by alarms and indications received in the control room. F. OPERATOR ACTIONS Plant operators performed required surveillances, secured the Unit 1 EDGs, and proceeded to restore the availability of startup power to Unit 1. G. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES All Unit 1 EDGs started as designed with no problems observed. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM A. IMMEDIATE CAUSE The 230 kV Line Differential Relay 287 was inadvertently actuated due to maintenance activities on the 12 kV startup relay board (Panel RU) where Relay 287 is installed. As part ofthe maintenance work being conducted during 2R16, a reciprocating saw was used to cut an opening in Panel RU, which is common to both Units I and 2. Mechanical vibration induced by the power tool caused the relay to actuate, thus opening Breaker 52VU12 and isolating startup power. B. CAUSE Cause to be provided in a supplemental report following the completion of a root cause evaluation (RCE). IV. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES At DCPP, the 230 kV system is the only offsite power system which is designed to be immediately available to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents; therefore, this event could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function of the offsite electric power system. However, the Class IE on site EDGs remained available and would have provided power following a loss of offsite power. The voltage on operating buses was not affected by the isolation of 230 kV startup power, and the EDGs were not required since all vital buses were powered by the Unit 1 main generator. As a result, no vital loads were affected by this event. The increased conditional core damage probability for this event was assessed and found to be less than 4E-07. This event had no adverse affect on the health and safety of the public. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A. IMMEDIATE CORRECTION ACTIONS PG&amp;E restored startup power and identified sensitive devices in the electrical panel that would need to be isolated or protected. Clearances were modified to add relays in the &quot;cut out&quot; position and maintenance ceased cutting methods involving a reciprocating saw. Instead, personnel were instructed to use a cutting wheel in order to minimize vibration. B. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE (CAPRs) CAPRs to be detailed in a supplemental report following the completion of a RCE. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
