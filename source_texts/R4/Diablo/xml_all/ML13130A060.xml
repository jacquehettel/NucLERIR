Other available SR indications showed no rise in cps. At the time, SR instrument N-31 was inoperable. Since operators considered N-32 inoperable while N-31 was already inoperable, the audible count rate in the control room was no longer reliable. DCPP determined this condition constituted a loss of a safety function required to maintain the reactor in a safe shutdown condition and was reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A).

Plant Conditions At the time of the event, Unit 2 was shut down for the Unit 2 Refueling Outage Cycle 17. No fuel movement was in progress. II. Problem Description A. Background Two separate and independent channels of instrumentation [IG], N-31 and N-32, provide source range (SR) neutron flux measurement capability at Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP). The installed SR measurement capability covers the range from approximately 10E-9 to 10E-3 percent power. The SR detectors [DET], preamplifier assemblies, and associated cabling [CBL] are designed to function in normal plant operating environments. This equipment is neither designed, nor required to be functional in an accident and/or a post-accident environment. The DCPP design also includes an independent Post Accident Monitoring System (PAMS)[IP]. PAMS channels N-S1 and N-S2 consist ofwide-range neutron flux instruments and SR indications, N-S3 and N-S4, and PAMS performs the associated monitoring, indication, and assessment functions under post-accident conditions. P AMS measurement capability covers the range from approximately 10E-8 to 100 percent power. Isolated analog output signals from the SR instrumentation drawers are sent to the Plant Process Computer (PPC) [10] for information, display, and trending purposes, as well as provide local indication on the control console. The SR instrumentation drawers also provide an input to a speaker [SPK] on the Audio Count Rate Drawer to provide an audio output for control room personnel and a High Flux at Shutdown alarm. These audible features provide operators prompt identification of unexpected changes in core [RCT] reactivity. This prompt identification is required to assure sufficient time for operator action to preclude progression ofan unplanned reactivity addition event at low power. Ifthe control room audible count rate is non-functional, both N-31 and N-32 must be declared inoperable, in accordance with Technical Specifications (TS) 3.9.3. B. Event Description On March 12, 2013, at 17:06 PDT, DCPP Unit 2 SR instrument N-32 experienced an unexpected increase in indicated counts per second (cps). Initial N-32 indications were about 8-10 cps. The increase in indicated cps caused a High Flux at Shutdown alarm [JA] in the control room [NA]. N-32 cps stabilized at about 100-140 cps. There were no abnormal indications on N-31, N-S1, or N-S2, and no fuel movement was in progress. Further inspection determined that slight movement ofthe N-32 signal cable produced repeatable upscale readings on the instrument. Operations declared N-32 inoperable, due to unreliable indication. Maintenance personnel concluded that the N-32 signal cable had an internal fault, and that they bumped it when performing approved maintenance on a different instrument cable. This preliminary conclusion will be verified with a vendor failure analysis and a DCPP causal determination. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

The maintenance was complete and N-51 indication was normal, but the instrument was not yet declared operable. Additionally, N-31 was already inoperable. A leaking reactor cavity seal [SEAL] had introduced moisture, which caused unreliable instrument indication. However, at the time ofthe N-32 cps increase, N-31 indication was normal. Therefore, when operators declared N-32 inoperable while N-31 was already inoperable, the control room audible count rate indication was no longer reliable. DCPP determined this condition constituted a loss ofa safety function required to maintain the reactor in a safe shutdown condition. On March 12, 20l3, at 21:58 PDT, DCPP made an 8-hour nonemergency report (see NRC Event Number 48819) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(A). </P><P>C. Status ofInoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event </P><P>At the time ofthe event, Train A SR instrument N-31 was inoperable as a result of a leaking cavity seal that allowed moisture to cause unreliable indication. Cable testing confirmed insulation [INS] degradation and increased noise sensitivity. PAMS Channel A instrument N-51 was also inoperable for scheduled maintenance. The maintenance was complete and N-51 indication was normal, but the instrument was not yet declared operable. </P><P>D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected </P><P>No other system or secondary function was affected. </P><P>E. Method of Discovery </P><P>The High Flux at Shutdown alarm, along with an increase in the audible count rate, sounded in the control room making operators immediately aware ofthe condition. </P><P>F. Operator Actions </P><P>Upon receiving the High Flux at Shutdown alarm, operators appropriately responded by entering alarm response Procedure AR PK03-07, &quot;Hi Flux at Shutdn Alarm.&quot; This procedure directed operators to enter operating Procedure OP AP-33, &quot;Uncontrolled Boron Dilution At Shutdown.&quot; Operators observed elevated N-32 counts, but no other signs ofa reactivity addition event. Therefore, operators declared N-32 inoperable and appropriately exited AP-33. Operators entered TS 3.3.1, action statements L.1 and L.2, and TS 3.9.3, action statements A.l, A.2, B.1, and B.2. </P><P>G.

Cause ofthe Problem DCPP will provide the cause in a supplemental report, following completion ofa vendor failure analysis and a causal determination. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The SR instruments provide protection from a rapid reactivity addition event at low power. At the time ofthe event, Unit 2 was shut down with all control rods fully inserted and all reactor trip breakers [BKR] open. These conditions ensure that a rapid reactivity addition event would not occur. A boron dilution event is a slow-moving reactivity addition. Other control room indications provided operators with SR indication. N-52 was operable. N-51 and N-31 were both inoperable, but indicating correctly. Audible control room indication provided by N-31 was also functioning, but deemed unreliable. Additionally, operators subsequently set PPC alarms to provide an audible alert to any increase in SR power level. Given these conditions, the likelihood of an uncontrolled reactivity addition from a boron dilution accident had a low probability and therefore, the increase in risk is negligible. V. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Corrective Actions DCPP established clearances to control sources of positive reactivity addition. Additionally, control room operators set PPC alarms to provide an audible alert to any increase in SR power level. These control room alarms served to replace the control room audible indication normally provided by the SR instruments. B. Other Corrective Actions DCPP will provide corrective actions in a supplemental report. VI. Additional Information A. Failed Components At the time ofthe event, Train A SR instrument N-31 was inoperable as a result of a leaking cavity seal that allowed moisture to cause unreliable indication. Cable testing confirmed insulation degradation and increased noise sensitivity due to the moisture. Preliminary results indicate that Train B SR instrument N-32 signal cable developed an internal fault. This fault caused unreliable indication that would vary when the N-32 signal cable was moved. This cable was previously tested on February 14, 2013, and showed no signs of an internal fault. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
