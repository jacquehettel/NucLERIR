A combination ofsustained high winds over 60 miles per hour and ambient air temperatures exceeding 97°F could reduce cooling capacity such that the emergency diesel generators would exceed design limits, contrary to the requirements of General Design Criteria (GDC) 2. On December 14,2013, at 16:32 PST, DCPP made an 8-hour, non-emergency report to the NRC (reference NRC Event Notification Number 49634) per 10 CFR 50.72(b )(3)(ii)(B). Upon identification ofthis condition, shift orders were issued that require, when conditions warrant, the implementation of existing procedural guidance to open plant doors. This will allow additional air flow, shown to provide adequate emergency diesel generator cooling to support continuous operation of the Unit 1 emergency diesel generators. An apparent cause evaluation concluded that PG&amp;E did not have a design process requirement in place to evaluate GDC-2 design criteria relative to SSC functional requirements other than for structural integrity issues. Plant procedures were revised to include this requirement and PG&amp;E will issue a design change to permanently modifY the plant to resolve the wind issue. This event did not adversely affect the health or safety ofthe public. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) r u.s.

Plant Conditions Unit 1 operated in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure throughout the event. II. Problem Description A. Background Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 has three emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [DG] that provide vital backup power to three electrical buses [BU] to mitigate the consequences of a design basis accident (DBA) whenever normal or offsite power sources [EK] are unavailable. DCPP EDGs are designed to function so that a single failure of any EDG will not jeopardize the capability of the remaining EDGs to start and provide power to operate the shutdown systems required to mitigate any DBA condition. The DCPP EDGs are cooled using engine-driven fans [FAN] that provide cooling air to the diesel generator radiators [HX]. The radiator fan draws air through the radiator, maintaining jacket water temperature and, in turn, maintaining lubricating oil temperature. Jacket water to the aftercooler also affects combustion air temperature. The radiator fan also draws ambient air through the engine compartment to cool the equipment housed within it. Inability to maintain adequate radiator air flow will result in a rise in EDG jacket water temperature, higher component temperatures in the engine compartments, derating of the engine due to increased combustion air temperature, higher lubricating oil temperatures, and high cylinder jacket temperatures. This could result in a failure of the EDGs to perform their safety function. For this analysis, &quot;sustained high winds&quot; is using as the average of Plant Process Computer (PPC) [PPC] data over a fifteen minute period. B. Event Description As reported in NRC EN 49634, DCPP identified that if atmospheric conditions were to develop that had both sustained high winds exceeding 60 miles per hour from the northwest (NW) to north northeast (NNE) direction, and ambient air temperature exceeding 97°F, the combination of these conditions could result in inadequate heat removal to support continuous operation of the Unit 1 emergency diesel generators. On Unit 1, the main EDG radiator fan discharge flow is directed from the radiator, vertically though the turbine building 107 foot elevation floor, horizontally toward the west, out of the building on the west wall, and vertically through the exhaust plenums [DUCT]. A second exhaust flow path, however, is available for Unit 1. This second path is directed north along the EDG exhaust silencers, then out of the north wall either through a small set of louvers at the 107 foot elevation or downward and out the north wall through louvers at the 85 foot elevation. </TH></TR></Table><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

NO </TD><TD>30F4 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2013 </TD><TD>009 </TD><TD>01 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Sustained high winds blowing from a direction between 3040 to 330 (NW to NNE) would oppose the normal air flow and create a backpressure on the EDG 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 radiator fans through the exhaust flow paths on the north side of the turbine building. This could prevent adequate air flow and cooling through the EDG radiators. High winds from the west would not adversely impact the exhaust flow out of the west wall plenum. The EDG ventilation system is not impacted by winds from other directions because of the site layout. At the time of discovery, all offsite and onsite power sources were operable. C. Status of Inoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event This issue is not currently impacting any plant equipment as winds are light and temperatures are mild. DCPP has no recorded evidence of sustained winds exceeding 55 miles per hour. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected A review of other systems, including the Unit 2 EDGs, concluded that design configurations preclude impacts from design basis winds and temperatures. Some of the systems reviewed had no safety or accident mitigation functions. E. Method of Discovery This was discovered during a review of the DCPP licensing basis by the PG&amp;E Licensing Basis Verification Program team. They were investigating a concern brought to them by an outside agency. F. Operator Actions Operators verified that the EDGs were operable and issued shift orders that require, when conditions warrant, the implementation of existing procedural guidance to open plant doors. This will allow additional air flow, shown to provide adequate emergency diesel generator cooling to support continuous operation of the Unit 1 EDGs. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause of the Problem An apparent cause evaluation concluded that PG&amp;E did not have a design process requirement in place to evaluate GDC-2 design criteria relative to SSC functional requirements other than for structural integrity issues. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences DCPP performed a probabilistic risk assessment and documented the results in a formal calculation (PRA Calculation SDP 13-07). The risk contribution of the as-found condition was below the low risk significance guidance, deemed a &quot;green&quot; risk. </TH></TR><Caption><P>FORM 366 (10-2010) </P></Caption></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) U.s.
