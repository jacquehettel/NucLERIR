EXPECTED SUBMISSION DA TE) [g] NO SUBMISSION DATE ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On March 6, 2014, at 09:06 PST, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 in Mode 5 and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, DCPP concluded the Unit 1 and Unit 2 emergency diesel generators (EDGs) radiator ventilation exhaust plenums were not sufficiently analyzed for tornado missiles. Additionally, DCPP identified that the EDGs engine exhaust pipes were not protected from tornado missiles. DCPP staff performed an operability assessment and concluded the EDGs remained operable. On March 6, 2014, at 16:33 PST, DCPP made an 8-hour, nonemergency report to the NRC (Event Notification 49879) per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), &quot;Unanalyzed Condition .&quot; During review of extent of condition this issue was determined to affect the ventilation systems associated with Unit 1 and Unit 2 480 V AC switchgear and battery/inverter equipment. Event Notification 49879 was updated on September 9, 2014, at 19:45 PDT. The cause was due to a misunderstanding of the DCPP tornado missile protection licensing basis. DCPP incorrectly extended the NRC approval of limited tornado protection exceptions to the EDG ventilation system redesign and modification. Corrective actions included retraining and requalifying all employees who perform 10 CFR 50.59 screens and evaluations including commissioning a Licensing Basis Verification Project to ensure the Current Licensing Basis is clear and to correct deficient 10 CFR 50.59 evaluations. DCPP is evaluating tornado missile risk using a probabilistic technique and will be pursuing a change to the tornado missile licensing basis via license amendment request.

Reportable Event Classification This event is reportable pursuant to the following criteria: • 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(8), &quot;Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety.&quot; • 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A-D), &quot;Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function.&quot; II. Plant Conditions Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 was in Mode 5 for refueling, and Unit 2 was operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. III. Problem Description A. Background DCPP Tornado Missile licensing basis considers three hypothetical missiles. A 108 Ib board, a 76 Ib schedule 40 pipe, and a 4,000 Ib automobile. Additional site-specific tornado missiles, such as siding and pull box or hatch covers, are evaluated to determine if they are more severe than the three hypothetical missiles. DCPP Units 1 and 2 each have three emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [DG] that provide vital backup power to three electrical buses [BU] to mitigate the consequences of a design basis accident (DBA) whenever normal or offsite power sources [EK] are unavailable. DCPP EDGs are designed to function so that a single failure of any EDG will not jeopardize the capability of the remaining EDGs to start and provide power to operate the shutdown systems required to mitigate any DBA condition. The DCPP EDGs are cooled using engine-driven fans [FAN] that provide cooling air to the diesel generator radiators [HX]. The radiator fan draws air through the radiator, maintaining jacket water temperature and, in turn, maintaining lubricating oil temperature. Jacket water to the aftercooler also cools combustion air. The radiator fan also draws ambient air through the engine compartment to cool the equipment housed within it. Inability to maintain adequate radiator air flow due to postulated tornado missile deformation of the radiator exhaust vent plenum could result in higher component temperatures in the engine compartments, derating of the engine due to increased combustion air temperature, higher lubricating oil temperatures, and high cylinder jacket temperatures. The EDGs exhaust system is designed to direct engine exhaust to the atmosphere. The exhaust system consists of an exhaust silencer and exhaust piping. Deformation of the EDG exhaust system due to postulated tornado missiles could increase engine exhaust back pressure and impair the EDGs' operation. </TH></TR></Table><P>-t </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

The 480 V switchgear and inverter ventilation system supports the safety function of the 480 V switchgear, 125 V DC inverters, and CSR equipment by providing adequate cooling via forced ventilation flow. A postulated tornado missile damaging the supply and exhaust fans associated with the 480 V switchgear and inverter ventilation system could result in the inability of the system to meet its safety function. B. Event Description On March 6, 2014, at 09:06 PST, as part of the Licensing Basis Verification Project (LBVP), DCPP identified an unanalyzed condition where the EDG exhaust plenums and exhaust piping were not adequately protected from tornado missiles. This is a nonconforming condition with DCPP licensing basis requirements. On March 6, 2014, at 16:33 PST, DCPP reported this unanalyzed condition to the NRC, Event Notification 49879. During the subsequent extent of condition review, a similar condition was identified, which affected the ventilation systems associated with Units 1 and 2 480 V AC switchgear and battery/inverter equipment. Event Notification 49879 was updated on September 9, 2014, at 19:45 PDT. C. Status of Inoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event This issue did not impact any plant equipment as no weather patterns capable of producing a tornado were forecast. DCPP has no recorded evidence of an onsite tornado. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. E. Method of Discovery LBVP identified an incorrect methodology was used to determine tornado wind loading on the Emergency Diesel Generator Ventilation System (EDGVS) plenum. Subsequent questions from the NRC resident inspector prompted an evaluation of the DCPP licensing basis for tornado missiles. This evaluation identified that the licensing basis requirements for EDGVS and exhaust pipes require protection from tornado missiles. F. Operator Actions Operators verified that the EDGs were operable and no weather patterns capable of producing a tornado were forecast. Operators established shift orders that incorporated the following compensatory measures: </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) u.s.

Monitor the National Weather Service for a Tornado Watch on a three-hour periodicity. 2. Upon receipt of a Tornado Watch, remove or secure potential missile sources that are more severe than the design basis missiles. 3. Implement the DCPP &quot;Hot Weather Plan&quot; upon receipt of a Tornado Watch notification. G. Safety System Responses None. IV. Cause of the Problem PG&amp;E has determined that the failure to include missile impactive loading in the 1995 redesign and modification of the EDGVS plenum was due to a misunderstanding of the DCPP tornado missile protection licensing basis. DCPP incorrectly extended the NRC approval of limited tornado protection exceptions to the EDGVS redesign and modification. V. Assessment of Safety Consequences DCPP performed a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) and documented the results in a formal calculation (PRA Calculation SOP 14-01). This calculation was updated to include the 480 V AC Switchgear and 125 V DC Inverter Rooms Ventilation Systems as a result of the extent of condition review. With such low tornado frequencies at the site, it was concluded that tornado missile-initiated scenarios were insignificant contributors to the overall core damage frequency. The incremental core damage probability (lCDP) was less than the acceptance criteria of 1 E-06. Since the risk contribution of the as-found condition was below the low risk significance guidance, this condition is of very low safety significance. Therefore, this condition has negligible impact to the health and safety of the public. VI. Corrective Actions A. Immediate Actions: 1. Potential missile sources which may be more severe than the hypothetical design basis missiles were either anchored in place or removed from the zone of influence. 2. Portable ventilation equipment was relocated to designated areas of the turbine building that are protected from tornado missiles to ensure there is an adequate inventory of backup ventilation equipment available following a tornado event to support the 480 V AC Switchgear and 125 V DC I nverter Rooms Ventilation Systems. B. Other Corrective Actions 1.
