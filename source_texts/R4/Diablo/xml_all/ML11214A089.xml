PLANT CONDITIONS When the events occurred, Unit 1 was in Mode I (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent power. II. DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM A. BACKGROUND The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) electrical systems are designed to ensure an adequate supply of electrical power to all essential auxiliary equipment during normal operation and under accident conditions. Nonvital 4.16 kV alternating current (AC) auxiliary buses are energized by either of the offsite power sources. Vital AC buses IEAIIBU) have an additional available source: on site power delivered by diesel generators. The electrical systems are designed so that failure of anyone electrical device will not prevent operation of the minimum required engineered safety feature (ESF) equipment. General Design Criteria (GDC) 17 states, in part, &quot;An onsite electric power system and an offsite electric power system shall be provided to permit functioning ofstructures, systems, and components important to safety. The safety function for each system (assuming the other system is not functioning) shall be to provide sufficient capacity and capability to assure that (I) specified acceptable fuel design limits and design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational occurrences and (2) the core is cooled and containment integrity and other vital functions are maintained in the event of postulated accidents.&quot; DCPP offsite power is supplied by two systems that are physically and electrically separated and independent of each other: a 230 kV system and a 500 kV system. This satisfies requirements established by General Design Criteria (GDC) 17. The 230 kV system provides startup power and is immediately available following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) to assure that core cooling, containment integrity, and other vital safety functions are maintained. To make power available to the vital 4.16 kV bUses, the 230 kV system provides power to Startup Transformer (SUT)IEAIIXFMR) I-I (230 kV to 12 kV), energizing the 12 kV bus which then feeds SUT 1-2 (12 kV to 4.16 kV). The 500 kV system provides for transmission of the plant's power output, and is also available as a delayed access source of offsite power after the main generator is disconnected. To produce onsite power, each unit has three emergency diesel generators (EDGs)IEKIIDG) which supply power to the 4.16 kV vital AC buses when power is unavailable or when a degraded voltage condition exists. After EDGs have started, they will supply power to their respective vital bus if the buses are deenergized. Ifthe vital buses are not deenergized, the EDGs will continue to run in standby mode, ready to provide power if required. The EDGs will also start in standby mode on loss of startup power availability. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM A. IMMEDIATE CAUSE PG&amp;E preliminarily concluded that human performance deficiencies during testing activities associated with the 230 kV electrical protection equipment caused the loss of 230 kV startup power. The event on May 26, 2011, appears to have been caused by personnel attaching test equipment to terminals associated with the incorrect 230 kV protection system circuit (incorrect current transformer). The event on May 27, 2011, was caused by personnel attaching test equipment to terminals associated with a 230 kV protection system relay on the incorrect unit. B.. CAUSE The cause will be provided in a supplemental report following the completion of a root cause evaluation (RCE). IV. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES At DCPP, the 230 kV startup system is the only offsite power system which is designed to be immediately available to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents; therefore, this event could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function of the offsite electric power system. However, the Class IE onsite EDGs remained available and would have provided power following a loss of offsite power. The voltage on operating 12 kV buses was not affected by the isolation of230 kV startup power, and the EDGs were not required since all vital buses were energized by Unit 1 auxiliary power (the Unit 1 main generator). As a result, no vital loads were affected by this event. The increased conditional core damage probability for this event was assessed and found to be less than 4E-07. This event had no adverse effect on the health and safety ofthe public. V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A. IMMEDIATE CORRECTION ACTIONS For the May 26,2011 event, PG&amp;E performed troubleshooting to verify that the circuit was configured per the approved design; no issues were noted. The day and nightshift employees that perform this work were briefed on the event and on the station human performance tools that prevent such occurrences. Shortly after, with direct management oversight, the current circuit loop functional test was re-performed successfully. For the May 27, 2011 event, PG&amp;E re-performed the pre-job breif, focusing on roles and responsibilities, and installed barriers on all in service relays that were not part of the testing. Management provided direct oversight, and independent verification was used for all restoration actions of the procedure. B. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE (CAPRs) CAPRs will be detailed in a supplemental report following the completion of a RCE. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (10·2010) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (1()&quot;2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.
