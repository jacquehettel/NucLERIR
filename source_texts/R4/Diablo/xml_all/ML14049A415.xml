While EDG 1-2 was still inoperable, a field operator inspected EDG 1-3 in order to familiarize himself with the location ofa drive belt he would be inspecting at the next step ofEDG 1-2 testing. At approximately 0752 PDT, the operator inadvertently caught his foot on the fuel oil priming pump fuel line which snagged and broke. This resulted in a second inoperable EDG on Unit 1, and constituted a reportable unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety and a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Reference EN 49663. On December 19, 2013, at 0953 PST, operators completed EDG 1-2 testing and declared it operable. At the time ofthe event, both offsite power circuits were operable. The cause ofthe event was identified as a knowledge gap -Operators did not have adequate knowledge ofthe published standards to prevent inadvertent operational events. Corrective actions included issuing Operations Standing Orders and Shift Orders emphasizing the standards as they apply to operators. This condition did not adversely affect the health and safety ofthe public. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (01-2014) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Plant Conditions At the time ofthe event, Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor [RCT] power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. Both offsite power circuits were operable. II. Problem Description A. Background Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 has three emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [DG] that provide vital backup power to each unit's three electrical buses [BU] to mitigate the consequences of a design basis accident (DBA) ifoff-site power sources are unavailable. DCPP EDGs are designed to function so that a single failure of any EDG will not jeopardize the capability ofthe remaining EDGs to start and provide power to operate the systems required to mitigate any DBA condition. DCPP technical specifications (TS) allow for one EDG to be inoperable for up to fourteen days, and two EDGs to be inoperable for up to two hours. B. Event Description On December 19, 2013, while operations was conducting testing on EDG 1-2 at the end of its maintenance outage windO\.y, a nuclear operator (NO) entered the EDG 1-3 room to use the telephone to coordinate with control room staff. Because the EDG 1-2 room was cleared ofpersonnel for testing, the NO took the opportunity in the EDG 1-3 room to familiarize himself with the location of a pump drive belt that he later would be inspecting on EDG 1-2 following its current testing Due to the 14-day extended Maintenance Outage Window on EDG 1-2, all other EDGs on Unit 1 were posted as protected equipment in accordance with DCPP Operations Procedure (OP) 0-36, &quot;Protected Equipment Postings.&quot; Contrary to posting restrictions, the NO entered the EDG 1-3 room and proceeded to the vicinity ofthe fuel oil booster pump [P] drive belt without authorization from the work control shift foreman. In the process of maneuvering out ofthe drive belt area, the NO broke the EDG 1-3 fuel oil priming pump discharge fuel line thereby rendering EDG 1-3 inoperable. With two EDGs inoperable, Unit 1 entered TS 3.8.1 Condition E. This placed the unit in a 2-hour action to get an additional EDG operable, or be in Mode 3 in 6 hours and Mode 5 in 36 hours. At the time ofthe event, both off-site power circuits were operable. This condition was entered into the ~orrective action program and was reported as an eight hour non-emergency report EN 49663. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), due to a reportable unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety and a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident, respectively. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Method ofDiscovery The operator that contacted the fuel oil line called the control room EDG operator to report the broken line. F. Operator Actions None. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause ofthe Problem A. Immediate Cause A human factors analysis was performed that concluded the event was caused by operator error. The immediate cause is the operator coming in contact with the fuel line causing a break. B. Cause Knowledge Gap -Operators did not have adequate knowledge ofthe established standards contained in OP 0-36 to prevellt inadvertent operational events. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences The risk contribution incremental core damage probability of this event was less than 1E-06, and therefore considered insignificant. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A </P><P>LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

</LI_Title></LI></L><P>A human factors analysis was performed that concluded the event was caused by operator error. The immediate cause is the operator coming in contact with the fuel line causing a break. </P><P>B. Cause </P><P>Knowledge Gap -Operators did not have adequate knowledge of the established standards contained in OP 0-36 to prevellt inadvertent operational events. </P><P>IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences </P><P>The risk contribution incremental core damage probability ofthis event was less than 1E-06, and therefore considered insignificant. </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Immediate Corrective Actions 1) The NO involved was held accountable. 2) On 12/19/13, a site wide supervisory stand-down was held by station leadership to ensure a greater understanding ofthe risk associated with our actions in the power plant and the responsibilities as supervisors to ensure risk is properly mitigated. B. Other Corrective Actions Interim Corrective Actions 1) On 12/20113 through 12/22/13, Operations Standing Orders and Shift Orders were issued clarifying expectations on what equipment must be protected when an EDG becomes unavailable, who may cross a protected equipment barrier, and that management authorization is required to pass a protected equipment barrier. Corrective Actions 1) This Shift Order has been communicated to all five crews by their respective Shift Managers. 2) On January 14,2014, an additional site wide communication was published that discussed the event, operational risk, procedural requirements, causes, and insights. VI. Additional Information As a prudent action, the protected equipment procedure is being elevated from an operating procedure to an interdepartmental administrative procedure that would apply to all personnel and require prior Operations management authorization to pass a barrier. A. Failed Components None. B. Previous Similar Events None. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
