This change eliminated the ABVS function to cool emergency core cooling system motors and eliminated the ABVS supply fans from the definition of an operable ABVS train. Following the 2002 change, contrary to the original intent of TS 3.7.12, both trains of supply fans were occasionally removed from service at the same time for maintenance, and single supply fans were removed from service longer than would have been permitted by TS 3.7.12. These events are therefore reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).

Plant Conditions At the time ofthe event, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at approximately 100 percent reactor [RCT] power with normal operating reactor coolant temperature and pressure. II. Problem Description A. Background The function ofthe Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) auxiliary building [NF] ventilation system (ABVS) [VF] is to filter [FL T] air from the area ofthe active emergency core cooling system (ECCS) components during the recirculation phase of a loss of coolant accident. The ABVS also provides environmental control oftemperature and humidity in the ECCS pump [P] room areas as well as the general auxiliary building areas. The ABVS is designed, built, and installed as Design Class I and is required to meet single failure criteria. The DCPP ABVS consists oftwo trains. Each train is powered by a separate vital bus [BU] and contains a separate supply fan [FAN] and exhaust fan. Both trains provide airflow through a single roughing and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter which is common to both trains for normal operations; and a single roughing filter, HEPA filter, and charcoal adsorber [ADS] bank and a single manually-initiated heater [EHTR] are common to both trains for emergency operations. Ductwork [DUCT], valves [V] or dampers [DMP], and instrumentation also form part ofthe system. Normally-open isolation dampers are arranged in series pairs so that the failure ofone damper to shut will not result in a breach of isolation. Dampers that permit air circulation are arranged in parallel pairs so that the failure of one damper to open will not result in a restriction in air flow. Supply fans introduce cooling air into the ABVS to assist in the environmental control oftemperature in the auxiliary building and the ECCS pump room area. Although the cooling function ofthe ABVS is important to long-term component operability, the supply fans and associated dampers are not required to be operable to meet the air cleanup function controlled by Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.12, &quot;Auxiliary Building Ventilation System.&quot; Following NRC approval ofDCPP License Amendment 135 to Unit 1 and Unit 2, the TS Bases 3.7.12 specified that the ABVS is considered operable when the individual components necessary to maintain the ECCS pump room filtration and temperature are operable in both trains. An ABVS train is considered operable when its associated supply and exhaust fans are operable. In 2002, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) revised DCPP TS Bases 3.7.12 to specify that the ABVS is considered operable when the individual components necessary to maintain the ECCS pump room filtration are operable in both trains. An ABVS train is considered operable when its associated exhaust fan is operable. This revision removed the supply fan from the definition of an operable ABVS train and deleted &quot;temperature&quot; from the definition of an operable ABVS, as described above. At the time the revision was implemented, DCPP personnel determined that the supply fan was not required for the ABVS train to be operable. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

DPR-80 and DPR-82 (TAC Nos. M98984 and M98985),&quot; dated May 28, 1999. C. Status ofInoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event None. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected None. E. Method of Discovery Plant personnel were performing a review of the ABVS licensing bases and questioned why TS Bases 3.7.12 did not specify the supply fan as necessary for an operable ABVS train. F. Operator Actions Operators established controls, via a standing order, to treat the associated supply fan as part ofthe required train following the questioning ofTS Bases 3.7.12. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause ofthe Problem DCPP's procedure for performing 10 CFR 50.59 evaluations was insufficient because it did not provide guidance regarding TS bases changes that change the intent ofthe TS requirements, and that those changes may require a license amendment. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences DCPP performed testing and analysis ofthe ABVS and determined that adequate ECCS component cooling is provided to both units by operation of both supply fans from either ofthe two units. PG&amp;E reviewed clearances ofthe ABVS supply fans for the past three years and concluded that two or more supply fans had been available at all times to respond to a demand. PG&amp;E therefore concludes that this event created no potential safety consequences for the ability ofthe ABVS to perform its intended cooling function and did not affect the health and safety of the public. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

Corrective Actions 1) DCPP will revise plant procedure TS3.ID2, &quot;Licensing Basis Impact Evaluation,&quot; to provide clear guidance regarding the potential for a license amendment, based on the nature of a TS Bases change or any other change that may impact the intent of the TS. 2) DCPP will revise plant procedure XI3.ID6, &quot;Technical Specification Bases Control Program,&quot; to provide clear guidance regarding the potential for a license amendment, based on the nature of a TS Bases change or any other change that may impact the intent ofthe TS. A cross-discipline technical review should consider off-normal plant configurations (such as surveillance, testing, and transients) when assessing the impact ofthe proposed change. VI. Additional Information None. </TH></TR></Table></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
