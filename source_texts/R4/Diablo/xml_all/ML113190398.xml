EXPECTED SUBMISSION DA TE) DNa SUBMISSION DATE 01 16 2012 ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On September 12, 2011, at 1745 PDT, operators declared the Unit 1 and 2 common control room envelope (CRE) boundary inoperable and entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS).&quot; This was due to discovery ofinadequately-documented CRE in-leakage test data. Plant personnel reviewing the test report (dated February 3, 2005) for the common CRE identified that three of the four ventilation alignments tested had values of in-leakage greater than zero standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM), yet Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) had concluded that these results were adequate to show that the CRE had no unfiltered in-leakage. At 2257 PDT on September 12,2011, PG&amp;E made an 8-hour non-emergency report (reference NRC Event Notification 47258) under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). On September 13, 2011, plant personnel verified that administrative controls were in place to maintain post-Ioss-of-coolant accident emergency core cooling system leakage at a rate that would ensure operator doses were maintained less than the Final Safety Analysis-Report accident analysis results for the highest in-leakage rate reported in the test. On October 18,2011, plant staff further identified that inadequate information was available in the report to conclude that the limiting condition for testing (where only one train of the CRVS was functioning) would result in zero SCFM in-leakage into the CRE. This was contrary to Regulatory Guide 1.197, &quot;Demonstrating Control Room Envelope Integrity at Nuclear Power Reactors.&quot; PG&amp;E updated Event Notification 47258 on September 16 and October 18,2011. PG&amp;E will provide new in-leakage test results, event cause, assessment of safety consequences, and corrective actions in a supplemental report following completion of system testing and its evaluation of this issue. </Figure><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER)U,S, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Plant Conditions At the time of discovery, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power. II. Description of Problem A. Background The Unit 1 and 2 common Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS) provides a protected environment from which operators can control the units from the common control room following an uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. The CRVS consists of two trains that recirculate and filter the air in the common control room envelope (CRE), and a CRE boundary that limits the in-leakage of unfiltered air (one CRVS train from each unit). The CRVS is an emergency system, parts of which may also operate during normal unit operations. Upon receipt of an actuating signal, the normal air supply to the CRE is isolated, and the stream of outside ventilation air from the pressurization system and recirculated control room air is passed through a system filter. The pressurization system draws outside air from either the north end or the south end of the turbine building based upon the wind direction or the absence of releases at the inlet. The prefilters remove any large particles in the air to prevent excessive loading of the high-efficiency particulate air filters and charcoal adsorbers [ADS]. The CRVS is designed to maintain a habitable environment in the Units 1 and 2 common CRE for the duration of the most severe Design Basis Accident without exceeding a 5 rem whole body dose or its equivalent to any part ofthe body using only one train of the CRVS. B. Event Description On September 12,2011, at 1745 PDT, operators declared the Unit 1 and 2 CRE inoperable and entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, &quot;Control Room Ventilation System (CRVS).&quot; This was due to discovery of inadequately-documented CRE in-leakage test data. Plant personnel reviewing the test report (dated February 3, 2005) for the common CRE identified that three of the four ventilation alignments tested had values of in-leakage greater than zero standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM). However, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) had concluded that these results were adequate to show that the CRE had no unfiltered in-leakage, and had provided this information to the NRC in a letter dated April 22, 2005. At 2257 PDT on September 12,2011, PG&amp;E made an 8-hour non-emergency report (reference NRC Event Notification 47258) under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). On September 13,2011, plant personnel verified that administrative controls were in place to maintain post-loss-of-coolant accident emergency core cooling system leakage at a rate that would ensure operator doses were maintained less than the Final Safety Analysis Report accident analysis results for the highest in-leakage rate reported in the test. . On October 18,2011, plant staff further identified that inadequate information was available in the report to conclude that the limiting condition for testing (where only one train of the CRVS was functioning) would result in zero SCFM in-leakage into the CRE. This was contrary to Regulatory Guide 1.197, &quot;Demonstrating Control Room Envelope Integrity at Nuclear Power Reactors.&quot; PG&amp;E updated Event Notification 47258 on September 16 and October 18,2011. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.

PG&amp;E will provide the test results and an assessment of the safety consequences in a supplemental report after completing its test results analysis and cause analysis. C. Status of Inoperable Structure, Systems, or Components That Contributed to the Event None. D. Other Systems or Secondary Functions Affected Inadequate CRE testing rendered both Unit 1 and 2 CRVS trains inoperable. However, the CRVS trains remained capable of performing their normal ventilation functions. E. Method of Discovery PG&amp;E investigations in response to questioning from the NRC Senior Resident Inspector about the 2005 CRE in-leakage testing led to the discovery of inadequate testing. F. Operator Actions Operators took required actions associated with TS 3.7.10.B, and implemented administrative controls to maintain post-Ioss-of-coolant accident emergency core cooling system leakage at a rate that would ensure operator doses were maintained less than the Final Safety Analysis Report accident analysis results for the highest in-leakage rate reported in the test. G. Safety System Responses None. III. Cause of the Problem PG&amp;E will provide the cause in a supplemental report after completing its test results analysis and cause analysis. IV. Assessment of Safety Consequences This event did not result in failure of equipment, radiological release to plant personnel or the public. Therefore, this event did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public. PG&amp;E will provide a more detailed assessment of safety consequences in a supplemental report after completing its test results analysis and cause analysis. V. Corrective Actions PG&amp;E will provide corrective actions in the supplemental report after completing its test results analysis and cause analysis. </TH></TR></Table><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (10-2010) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) u.s.
