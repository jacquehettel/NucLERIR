Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) Level Switch (FS ILS2000 A2) supplies the low level trip function for both Spent Fuel Pool cooling pumps and the SFP purification pump. The failure of the level switch or loss of power to the level switch will cause all three pumps to trip with no restart capabilities. A temporary modification was created that would allow operations to defe?t the level switch interlock and restore SFP cooling in the unlikely eventof a failureor loss of power of this switch. On January 13, 2010 as a result of continued evaluation of this condition, it was recognized that this condition is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(ii) (Degraded or Unanalyzed Condition) and 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(vii) (Common Cause Inoperability of Independent Trains or Channels) due to one failure being able to disable the safety function of both SFP cooling pumps. The Updated Fillal Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and General Design Criteria (GDC) require the SFP coolin~ pumps to meet single failure independence. No actual FS ILS2000 A2 failure occurred, this design condition was identified during work preparation. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366 (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s.

The Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and General Design Criteria (GDC) require the SFP cooling pumps to meet single failure independence. No actual FS ILS2000 A2 failure occurred, this condition was identified during w()rk preparation. INITIAL CONDITIONS This condition was identified during a work planning review. No failure of FS ILS2000 A2 occurred. This was a previously unrecognized single failure that could result in the loss of multiple SFP cooling pumps. EVENT DESCRIPTION Spent Fuel Pool Level Switch FS ILS2000 A2 supplies the low level trip function for both the Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) cooling pumps &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the SFP purification pump. Failure of the level switch or loss of power to the level switch will cause all three pumps to trip with no restart capabilities. This condition is reportable under 1 OCFR50.73(a)(2)(ii) as described in NUREG-1022 (Event Reporting Guidelines) Section 3.2.4 (Degraded or Unanalyzed Condition). NUREG-1022 Section 3.2.4 lists a reportable event as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety due to the discovery that a system required to meetthe single failure criterion does not do so; </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

I </P><P>1 OCFR50 Appendix A (General Design Criteria (GDC)) 44 Cooling Water lists the following </P><P>requirements: A system to transfer heat from structures, system, and components important to safety, to an ultimate heat sink shall be provided. The system safety function shall be to transfer the combined heat load of these structures, systems, and components under normal operating and accident conditions. </P><P>Suitable redundancy in components and features, and suitable interconnections, leak </P><P>. detection, and isolation capabilities shall be provided to assure that for onsite electric power system operation (assuming offsite power is not available)'and for offsite electric power system operation (assuming onsite power is not available) the system safety function can be accomplished,·assuming single failure. </P><P>UFSAR 9.1.3.1 states the following: The assume,d single failure for a partial core discharge is the faiiure of a divisional electrical bus which takes out a redundant train of cooling water pumps. </P><P>The limiting single failure in calculation ECM98-067'(Limiting Single Failure Thermal Hydraulic Analysis of Waterford 3 Spent Fuel Pool) is the failure of a divisional electrical bus and is non conservative b,ecause the newly identified limiting single failure is more adverse. </P><P>Based upon the unrecognized single failure identified in the corrective action program condition report (CR-WF3-2009-4908), the requirements of GDC 44 are not met and the UFSAR 9.1.3.1 and ECM98-067 limiting single failures are non conservative. NUREG-1022 reportability criteria is met due to a system required to meet single failure criterion not meeting this requirement. </P><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9·2007) u.s.

NUREG-1022 Section 3.2.8 states: Trains or channels for reportability purposes are defined as those redundant, independent trains or channels designed to provide protection against single failures. Analysis of events reported under this part of the rule. may identify previously unrecognized common-cause (or dependent) failures' and system interactions. Such failur:es can be simultaneous failures that occur because of a single initiating cause (Le., the'single cause or mechanism serves as a common input to the failures); or the failures can be sequential (Le., cascading failures), such as the case where a single component failure results in the failure of one or more additional components. The 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(ii) discussion above provides the same details on why this condition meets the reportability criteria under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(vii). . CAUSAL FACTORS This was a latent issue that w.as present in the spent fuel pool cooling design. UFSAR Section 9.1.3.2.4.3(a) states that the fuel pool water level is. monitored by a level switch. This switch actuates a high and a low alarm locally and in the main'control room to warn the operator of a system malfunction and trips the pumps. This information has existed since the initial FSAR. </TH></TR></Table><P>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) </P><Sect><H3>· . .</H3><P>~ </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A (9-2007) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

A temporary modification to jumper the FS ILS2000 A2 level switch was created such that the switch may be easilybypassed by operators if necessary to restore fuel pool cooling. Operations ·procedure·OP-901-513 (Spent Fuel Pool Cooling Malfunction) will be updated to include contingency steps to recover pumps by alternate means by using the temporary jumper to override the erroneous low level condition. The temporary modification to jumper the FS ILS2000 A2 level switch will be evaluated to determine if it should be made a permanent modification and associated actions will be taken. The engineering calculation ECM98-067 (Limiting Single Failure Thermal Hydraulic Analysis of Waterford 3 Spent Fuel Pool) and the UFSAR will be updated. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE UFSAR 9.1.3.3 states the following: Although it is unlikely that all cooling could be lost to the spent fuel storage pool, it would take approximately-2.89 hours for the bulk pool temperature to rise from 152°F to 212°F. This is based on a full core offload discharged starting three days after reactor shutdown. The corresponding heat load is 51.5 x 10E6 Btu/hr. This time period allows sufficient time for the operators to intervene and line up an alternate source of replenishing the pool inventory and removing the decay heat. . The tem'porary modification provides a preplanned method to jumper FS ILS2000 A2 level switch: which would ensure the UFSAR previously stated operator action to restore spent fuel pool cooling could be met. The failure of the level switch from loss of power is extremely unlikely as .it is powered from a static uninterruptable power supply. </TH></TR></Table><P>9,2007) </P><P>I •• &quot; </P><Table><TR><TH>NRC FORM 366A u.s, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (9-2007) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) CONTINUATION SHEET </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.

Spent fuel pool cooling would have still been capable of being restored but the duration may have been longer than the limiting (full core offload) time of 2.89 hours but should have still been within the near term. The loss of both SFP cooling pumps caused by the failure of this level switch would generate an immediate alarm in the main control room and an additional control room alarm would be generated as fuel pool temperature increased. With the control room alarms, operations would enter their off normal procedure and take the actions needed to restore SFP cooling. Technicians are continually staffed and would have been available to assist in troubleshooting and installing jumpers around the SFP level switch. If boiling were to occur in the SFP, SFP makeup would still ensure that spent fuel remained covered which would ensure the fuel clad temperatures remained within the design limits. Boiling temperatures are slightly above the SFP component design temperatures (refer to UFSAR Table 9.1-3) but for a short term transient is judged to still be able to perform their intended function once the SFP cooling pumps are returned to service. The other primary concern is associated with potential dose consequences due to boiling. With the spent fuel remaining covered and spent fuel pool cooling being restored in the near term, the potential event consequences are judged to remain bounded by the fuel handling accident (UFSAR Section 15.7.3.4). This condition is considered to have a low safety significance.
